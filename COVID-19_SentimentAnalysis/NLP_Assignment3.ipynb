There’s “really nothing here for the bears to highlight,” added the analyst, who cut his rating on the stock to underperform just two weeks ago.\\nJonas is among 18 analysts surveyed that have a sell-equivalent rating on Tesla, twice the amount that rate the shares a buy. While short interest has declined as the stock rallied in recent months, it remains at about 11 per cent of the free float, according to IHS Markit data.\\nTesla has been on a dizzying rally so far this year, adding 39 per cent in value through Wednesday and sending analysts scrambling to boost their price targets. Even still, shares took off after the earnings beat with impressive speed, jumping nearly US$80 apiece in less than an hour.\\nThe stock surged as much as 12 per cent to $650.88 in New York, making it the best performer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index over the past twelve months.\\nHere’s what else analysts had to say:\\nWedbush Dan Ives\\nNeutral, price target US$550\\n“We would characterize the fundamental performance as impressive, with clear momentum looking ahead as a global inflection in electric vehicle demand appears on the horizon.”\\nResults indicate lower costs, more production efficiency, and “extremely impressive” automotive gross margins\\nBulls may also focus on the aggressive trajectory of Giga 3 production and demand out of Shanghai. Hitting the important 500,000 delivery threshold for full-year 2020 is well within reach as now, based on Wedbush’s Chinese demand scenario analysis.\\nRBC, Joseph Spak\\nUnderperform, price target raised to US$530 from US$315\\nAdmits to being “misguided” in some assumptions, and thus, significantly raises his estimates post-results. However, on a reasonable base case, still believes Tesla is overvalued.\\nNotes that, despite the “slight” revenue increase, total gross profit and automotive gross profit declined year-on-year.\\nBut “if bulls keep dreaming the dream,” there’s room to run to RBC’s $928 a share upside case.\\nJefferies, Philippe Houchois\\nBuy, price target US$600\\nQuarterly earnings were as expected, but free cash flow was two-times consensus. With net debt also lower and 2020 volume guidance above 500,000 there’s room for consensus to move higher.\\nNotes Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk dismissed raising capital as unnecessary, arguing Tesla is not in any way holding back investment.\\nHowever, lack of capital expenditure guidance is disappointing, while the unfolding coronavirus creates some uncertainty, with a 1-2 week mandated shutdown in Shanghai.\\nCitigroup, Itay Michaeli\\nSell, price target US$222\\nResults are another positive, if not impressive, step forward. However, given current market capitalization, don’t see many incrementally supportive data points.\\nIn fact, see some negatives regarding near-term full self-driving capabilities. Magnitude of the beat and underlying metrics was underwhelming, while 2020 delivery guidance could be viewed as light versus the guidance given at first quarter 2019.\\nCautious on chasing the stock amid a number of flaws in the bull case regarding North American demand and Tesla’s automated vehicles positioning.\\nCanaccord Genuity, Jed Dorsheimer\\nBuy, price target US$750 from US$515\\n“Essentially flat gross margins compared to the prior quarter were a meaningful feat given the ramp associated with Gigafactory Shanghai moving to begin production, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9 per cent, and we expect to see that number improve as deliveries of Chinese Model 3s begin.”\\n“Given the numerous positive data points that were discussed and the cornerstone of continued profitability and free cash flow generation, we view the company as solidly positioned as the leader of the electric vehicle revolution.”\\n--With assistance from Sam Unsted, James Cone and Lisa Pham.\\nRelated ']\n",

      "Attaining the projected growth rate of 6-6.5% will be challenging. The demand cycle is yet to pick up in India. Global growth including India is likely to be significantly impacted by the Coronavirus factor, taking cues from the history of impacts from the SARS outbreak. We can possibly infer a significantly higher government spending in the next fiscal from these projected growth numbers and will have to await the Budget announcements tomorrow for the same.”\n",
      "Rumki Majumdar, Economist, Deloitte India\n",
      "The data scan by the economic survey suggests that the economic slowdown may be tapering with green shoots visible in a few quarters of the economy. India can take advantage of the global situation as India remains an attractive investment destination because of the untapped potential of the domestic demand and massive infrastructure spending plans; rising number of millennials in the population (impacting both the nature of consumption and workforce); and the rapidly evolving entrepreneurial ecosystem. All eyes are now on tomorrow’s budget as the government walks a tightrope of balancing growth and inflation.\n",
      "Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist, ICRA\n",
      "We echo the Economic Survey’s comment that the government must expedite reforms to usher in a strong economic rebound in FY2021. This is particularly critical given the limited room, if any, for further monetary easing, with the headline CPI inflation likely to remain sticky above the MPC’s medium-term target of 4% until September 2020.\n",
      "Moreover, a concerted nudge by the Government to reboot the virtuous cycle of investment-led growth, as advocated by the Survey, would be crucial for economic growth to revive to the upper end of the range of 6.0-6.5% forecast for FY2021, and eventually feed into the goal of expanding the Indian economy to USD 5 trillion.\n",
      "Elias George, Partner and National Head – Infrastructure, Government and Healthcare (IGH), KPMG\n",
      "Realizing economic growth targets and attaining national aspirations call for not just renewed focus and investment in key sectors like infrastructure and rural empowerment, but also on establishing and enabling a climate of trust. Consequently, the survey’s emphasis on strengthening India’s trust economy and on the creation of simpler and speedier contractual enforcement regimes are indeed most welcome.\n",
      "The focus of the survey on further simplifying processes involved in setting up new businesses, as well as on facilitating business aspirations at a district level is in accordance with its overarching goal of equitable and universal wealth creation.\n",

      "Daksha Baxi, Head – International Taxation, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\n",
      "There needs to be a solution to tax terrorism and some efforts need to be put into fostering trust and cordial relationships between the tax department and businesses. Taxpayers need to see the benefit of paying taxes. Perhaps some focused attention can be given to this. It will go a long way in reducing the pinch that taxpayers feel about paying taxes.\n",
      "The concrete steps for the economy to grow and the road map need to be charted out and much more confidence needs to be generated. Also, there needs to be better coordination amongst various agencies for citizens to see the benefits of better governance.\n",
      "Arindam Guha, Partner, Deloitte India\n",
      "The survey has clearly articulated the case for accelerating strategic divestment – it is expected that this will constitute a major source of financing in the forthcoming Budget 2020-21. The survey has rightly identified focus areas for further improving ease of doing business like starting a business, registering property, paying taxes and enforcing contracts.\n",
      "However, while some of them are under the direct control of the Government of India and its associated agencies, others, like registering property and enforcing contracts, are under the administrative jurisdiction of either the State Governments or the Judiciary and would require suitable measures to facilitate collaborative action.\n",

      "Novena Global Lifecare (NGL)’s (through its subsidiary Novena Bellagraph Healthcare) donation is the first of its kind from Singapore Company and coincides with the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaration of the Wuhan epidemic as an international emergency. The medical supply donation will benefit medical organisations in China including those in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, which is facing a serious shortage of medical supplies such as surgical masks, medical gloves and clothing etc.\n",
      "SINGAPORE, Novena Global Lifecare (the \"Company\" or \"NGL\"), one of Asia’s largest integrated medical healthcare and aesthetic companies, with over 250 clinics in 20 cities mainly in the Asia-Pacific region, will donate up to one million masks & other medical supplies to hospitals in China including Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China. As a company with a significant presence in North Asia, NGL (through its subsidiary Novena Bellagraph Healthcare) hopes to do its bid to help win the fight against the outbreak. NGL will work with the following organisations such as the China Youth Charitable Foundation, a national non-profit and non-governmental organisation based in China, and Shanghai Ruijin Hospital medical team, which is sending an emergency medical support team to oversee the Wuhan Treatment Center, also known as the Jinyintan Hospital, as well as the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention (SCDC) to help ship the medical supplies from overseas sources to China. The outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic has caused an acute shortage of healthcare supplies as people rush to buy items such as surgical masks, gloves and hand sanitisers. NGL’s donation in medical supplies is timely given that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has just declared the Wuhan epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). This declaration means that, among other measures, national health authorities around the world are recommended to step up their monitoring, preparedness and containment measures. The PHEIC status also pushes nations to coordinate funding, personnel and other resources, and helps countries persuade residents to follow health recommendations. NGL’s Executive Chairman and Co-founder, Mr Nelson Loh, said: \"The coronavirus epidemic once again reminds us of how small the world is and how we are all living in the same global village. As a regional healthcare player, we want to do our part in minimising the risk exposure to the virus and we hope our movement will spark more regional companies to step up in aid.\"\"We hope the aid will provide the necessary protection for the frontline healthcare workers in Wuhan, who are working tirelessly to contain the spread of the coronavirus and treat the sick at ground zero.\" NGL’s CEO and Co-founder, Mr Terence Loh, said: \"We decided to reallocate a portion of our medical resources which was originally intended for our Shanghai Flagship Novena Bellagraph Hospital Project to this cause as we felt it was the right thing to do. NGL remains ready to contribute in any way in countries where NGL operates in as and when needed.\" About Novena Global Lifecare Novena Global Lifecare (NGL) is one of the largest integrated medical healthcare and aesthetic groups regionally with presence in Singapore, Mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, India and Malaysia.

Most of the cases are reported in Hubei province. The outbreak was first reported in Wuhan last month. The city of around 11 million now remains in lockdown.In an effort to contain the novel coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have suspended air, road, and rail travel in the area around Wuhan and placed restrictions on travel and other activities throughout the country. On Thursday, U.S. Department of State updated its Travel Advisory to Level 4, advising its citizens not to travel to China.Those currently in China have been urged to consider departing using commercial means. The State Department has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus. In the United States, where 5 people were confirmed positive in lab tests, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expanding entry screening to 20 U.S. Ports of Entry with quarantine stations.Meanwhile, no symptoms of coronavirus were found in any of the 195 U.S. passengers from Wuhan, who were on board a flight that landed at March Air Reserve Base in California. However, they have be asked to stay on the base in quarantine.CDC is continuing to screen all passengers coming from Wuhan in five international airports.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Thursday confirmed that 2019-nCoV has spread between two people in the United States, representing the first instance of person-to-person spread with this new virus in the country.Previously, all confirmed U.S. cases had been associated with travel to Wuhan.

      "The World Health Organization announced Thursday that the outbreak of a deadly and fast-spreading strain of coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency.\n",
      "\"Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen, which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.\n",
      "However, Tedros was adamant that \"the main reason for the declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries. ... Let me be clear — this vote is not a declaration of no confidence in China.\" He said that the WHO is deeply concerned about what will happen if the virus begins spreading in countries with weak health systems and that the purpose of the declaration is to help those countries.\n",
      "The declaration of a global health emergency can work to galvanize international funding. According to the WHO's procedures , the three criteria for such a declaration are that it is an \"extraordinary event,\" that it \"constitute[s] a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease\" and that it \"potentially require[s] a coordinated international response.\"\n",
      "The last time the WHO announced an international health emergency was in July 2019 over the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Before that, international emergencies were declared in 2016 for the Zika virus and in 2014 for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n",
      "Also on Thursday, the U.S. State Department issued a \"do not travel\" advisory for China.\n",
      "\"Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China,\" the advisory reads. \"Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus.\"\n",
      "The new coronavirus has sickened around 9,800 people worldwide and killed at least 213 , all of them in China.\n",
      "The WHO said in a statement that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.\n",
      "\"There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. WHO doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement,\" Tedros added. But the WHO also said that in certain circumstances, such as when there are many cases of transmission among a vulnerable population, such measures could be \"temporarily useful.\"\n",
      "The coronavirus drew worldwide attention after Chinese authorities began reporting cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan last month. They were able to pinpoint the cause to a previously unknown strain. Other forms of coronavirus, such as SARS and MERS, have been responsible for past international outbreaks.\n",
      "Health authorities believe this particular strain, known as 2019-nCoV, likely first spread from an animal. China's National Health Commission has said it is associated with exposure at a seafood market in Wuhan that also sold live animals.\n",
      "Since then, the virus has spread from Wuhan to countries around the world, including the United States, Japan, Singapore and Thailand. \"The vast majority of those cases are still associated with travel to Wuhan,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program.\n",
      "\"We know that this virus can cause severe disease and that it can kill, although for most people it causes milder symptoms,\" Tedros told reporters last week. The WHO said that about 20% of those infected experience severe illness .\n",
      "Experts find the new coronavirus particularly concerning for several reasons. First, the WHO said there is evidence that the virus could spread from human to human. \"The disease is mainly a respiratory disease passing via droplets from one person to another and mostly still through close contact,\" Ryan said.\n",
      "The droplets could come from sneezing, coughing or even talking. This is worrying because it is easier for a virus to spread quickly between humans compared with a virus transmitted from an animal to humans. Human-to-human transmission has now been documented in three countries outside China, Tedros said.\n",
      "Second, experts still don't know for certain what animal the virus originated from in Wuhan. \"Until we know what the animal is, there potentially could still be animals being sold in markets all across China that is spilling virus over into people,\" Matthew Frieman, a virologist with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, recently told NPR's Nurith Aizenman .\n",
      "And third, Chinese authorities say the virus has also infected medical workers — people who already would be taking serious precautions to protect themselves.\n",
      "There is currently no targeted drug to treat the virus, Chinese health authorities said. And there is no vaccine to guard against it. Tedros is calling on countries to \"accelerate the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\"\n",
      "Several countries, including the U.S., have started to evacuate citizens from Wuhan because of concerns about the coronavirus. As NPR's Bill Chappell reported , American passengers broke into cheers after their flight from Wuhan touched down Tuesday night in Alaska. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising that travelers \"avoid all nonessential travel to all of [China].\"\n",
      "Major airlines, such as United Airlines and British Airways, have suspended flights to Chinese cities.\n",
      "Chinese health authorities recently announced new sweeping measures to try to contain the new coronavirus by implementing a strict quarantine on Wuhan, a city of some 11 million people. \"There's no sense of when the quarantine might be lifted,\" NPR's Emily Feng reported from Beijing. \"The big problem is that people are going to have to return to work soon, when the Lunar New Year is over. Many of them are coming from villages where there are very few screening measures for the virus.\"\n",
      "China's government has come under criticism for not responding more quickly to the outbreak. But WHO officials have praised the Chinese response.\n",
      "\"The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak, despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the Chinese people,\" Tedros said. \"In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response.\" Copyright 2020 NPR.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said that the novel coronavirus outbreak has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). However, the UN health body stressed that it does not recommend limiting trade and travel. It also once again spoke highly of China's prevention and containment measures. (Xinhua/Chen Junxia)\n",
      "GENEVA, Jan. 30 -- World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that the novel coronavirus outbreak has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n",
      "Speaking at a press conference after a closed-door meeting of the Emergency Committee, he stressed that the WHO disfavors or even opposes imposing travel or trade restrictions on China.\n",
      "Under the International Health Regulations (IHR), the WHO director-general has the authority to determine that an outbreak constitutes a PHEIC when certain conditions are met. The designation is aimed at mobilizing more international resources to deal with the epidemic.\n",
      "Since the IHR entered into force in 2007, the WHO has made multiple PHEIC declarations.\n",
      "Ghebreyesus noted that Chinese President Xi Jinping personally commands and deploys the prevention and containment efforts.\n",
      "\"The speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO and the world are very impressive, and beyond words. So is China's commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries,\" he said.\n",
      "\"In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response,\" he added.\n",
      "That reflects not only China's high sense of responsibility for the lives and health of its own people, but also its strong support for global disease prevention and control, he said.\n",
      "Ghebreyesus said he believes that China will effectively contain and eventually defeat the epidemic, adding that China's efforts to combat the disease deserve respect and appreciation, and are worth learning.\n",
      "In fact, many of the prevention and containment measures China has taken far exceed relevant requirements for dealing with emergencies, and the measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world.\n",
      "Now the situation is still developing and more research is needed, and particularly countries with fragile health systems should enhance their responses, said the WHO chief.\n",
      "That is the main reason behind the PHEIC declaration, he said, adding that considering global health security, it is also a necessary step to achieve a scientific, rational and calm response based on evidence, and to help other countries take scientific, reasonable and appropriate measures to prevent the epidemic.\n",

      "Many of them may have to resort to production cutbacks if the health crisis worsens in China, where entire cities have been under lockdown due to the disease outbreak, according to industry executives. While the March quarter should be easy to manage, most of the impact will become clear in a month or so, they said.\n",
      "The fact that the coronavirus outbreak happened during the Chinese New Year holiday period helped companies as they had to plan in advance for this quarter.\n",
      "“If they are unable to solve this by 15 February, that will impact the manufacturing dependent industry from March onwards,\" said S.N. Rai, co-founder and director of Lava. Rai said companies would have stocked up in advance for the January to March segment.\n",
      "“The situation will be very precarious if this continues for another 15-30 days, because in the electronics industry you can’t manufacture even if one component is missing,\" he added.\n",
      "Devita Saraf, founder, chairman and CEO of television manufacturer Vu Technologies, said that it might be too early to make assessments right now. She said that while summer inventories for television companies might be hurt, this quarter shouldn’t see much impact.\n",
      "Essentially, a prolonged disruption will see production capacities going down but little change in demand for electronic products in India.\n",
      "That said, Rai added that costs aren’t expected to increase at the moment, and if they do then companies will have to pass them on to customers. However, he added that market-level shortages won’t reflectfor at least four weeks right now.\n",
      "Arvinder Khurana, president of the All India Mobile Retailers Association, said that based on his conversations with mobile phone companies such as Realme, Oppo and Vivo, among others, that assemble products in India, stocks or prices of products shouldn’t be impacted. He said most smartphone makers have started assembling products in India, which means they already have components for this quarter.\n",
      "“Brands have components and stocks for an entire quarter in advance usually, so there shouldn’t be any impact in this quarter,\" he said.\n",
      "If the disruptions extend for more than a month, production could be seriously hurt, suggested N.K. Goyal, president of Cellular Manufacturers Association of India. He said that even today 80% of all components are imported from China, which means there will be a shortage even for companies making in India if the coronavirus lockdown extends over a month.\n",

As a result, employees who had travelled to China for the Chinese New Year are unable to return to India, while others had to cancel their plans to travel to China.\n",
      "Further, many of the Chinese companies also depend on their Chinese units for software R&D. This is the side of the business that takes care of smartphone user interfaces, apps and other software.

So, certainly, there is a potential majority in favour of a rate cut today and the economic case for a rate cut looks strong too,” Daiwa said.\n",
      "“On balance, we expect the majority of members to keep Bank Rate at 0.75% for a little longer yet, while also raising further the possibility of a near-term rate cut if and when the economic data fail to improve sufficiently over the near term; however, we would certainly not be surprised if the MPC voted for a 25bp rate cut today for risk management reasons and we maintain our forecast that Bank Rate will be cut to 0.5% by May at the latest,” Daiwa added, giving a masterclass in hedging its bets.\n",

      "Tweet: Gold, with 3.95 percent gain, has outperformed benchmark Nifty (down 1.8 percent) and Sensex (down 1.6 percent) in January on safe-haven buying amid economic slowdown concerns due to the fast-spreading Coronavirus in China. The virus has taken the lives of 213 people so far, with 9,809 confirmed cases as many countries stated plans to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. Gold prices dipped Rs 57 to Rs 40,791 per 10 gram in the Mumbai bullion market on rupee appreciation. The yellow metal slipped after the World Health Organisation (WHO) came out against travel and trade restrictions in declaring global emergency over the spread of coronavirus that originated in China last year. The rate of 10 grams 22-carat gold in Mumbai was Rs 37,365 plus 3 percent GST, while 24-carat 10 gram was Rs 40,791 plus GST. The 18-carat gold Quote: d at Rs 30,593 plus GST in the retail market. According to Abhishek Bansal, Chairman and MD, Abans Group of Companies, Gold prices are marginally lower after the World Health Organization (WHO) said measures taken by China could control the coronavirus outbreak. The comments have eased fears among investors, and the risk premium has reduced marginally from gold. It is premature to predict the actual impact of the coronavirus. Fed Chairperson Jerome Powell is acknowledging the risks of a short-term slowdown in China due to the virus. Still, the economic impact is not quantifiable; if we see an escalation in the situation from the current levels, then a significant rally could be seen in precious metal prices, which are considered as a safe-haven during such a scenario. The virus has claimed 213 lives so far in China and has spread to at least 22 countries. Many cities in China are still facing a lockdown, and business activities are closed completely. Gold is considered a safe-haven during such situations. The gold/silver ratio currently stands at 87.92 to 1, which means the amount of silver required to buy one ounce of gold. Silver prices jumped Rs 225to Rs 46,395 per kg from its closing on January 30. The precious metal has gained Rs 634, or 1.58 percent for the week, while silver rose Rs 250 or 0.54 percent in the same period. In the futures market, gold rate touched an intraday high of Rs 41,014 and an intraday low of Rs 40,571 on MCX. For the February series, the yellow metal touched a low of Rs 36,098 and a high of Rs 41,293. Gold futures for delivery in February eased Rs 224, or 0.55 percent on the MCX trading at Rs 40,751 per 10 gram in evening trade in a business turnover of 575 lots. Gold contracts for April delivery slipped Rs 268, or 0.65 percent, at Rs 40,805 per 10 gram in a business turnover of 19,231 lots. The far month June contract was trading down by Rs 238, or 0.58 percent at Rs 40,930 per 10 gram with a business volume of 4,293 lots. The value of the February contract traded so far is Rs 2,326.75 crore and April contract saw the value of Rs 2,326.79 crore. Similarly, Gold Mini contract for March slipped Rs 210, or 0.51 percent at Rs 40,710 in a business turnover of 8,139 lots. The gold price has seen a strong pullback after testing 50 percent retracement level and the price is expected to trade positive. Sustaining above Rs 40,820 next leg of the positive rally would push the price higher towards Rs 41,000-41,100 levels, according to Axis Securities. On an hourly chart, the price has been trading above 60 EMA which is a bullish sign for price. The broking firm advised its clients to April gold at Rs 40,820 with stop loss at Rs 40,700 and target of Rs 41,000. MCX Gold has support at Rs 40,640-40,500 whereas resistance is at Rs 40,950-41,100. Sideway to positive movement is expected for the day, according to Motilal Oswal. The broking firm advised its clients to buy on dips targeting resistance at Rs 40,950-41,100. The brokerage firm said spot gold has key support at $1,560 whereas resistance is at $1,600. At 12:59 pm (GMT), spot gold was up $5.57 at $1,579.51 an ounce in London trading.Get \n",

      "Hospitalisation of people suspected of coronavirus infection has brought out systemic issues in airport screening and quarantine facilities in Mumbai.\n",
      "A 36-year-old man who was admitted to the quarantine ward in Mumbai’s Kasturba hospital has claimed there were neither in-flight announcements nor enquiries at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International (CSMI) airport for passengers, including those returning from China, to report cases of cough, cold or fever. He also claimed the hospital, an official isolation centre, maintained poor infection control system.\n",
      "The patient, who was on a business tour with three others to Guangzhou and Shushan, in China, for six days, told The Indian Express : “I had a cold before the trip. In China, I developed a fever once. There we didn’t realise the scale of the coronavirus outbreak.”\n",
      "On landing at CSMI airport on January 22, he claimed that no announcement were made inside the RwandAir flight on possible coronavirus infection. At the airport too, he claimed, no official informed him to report if he had any symptoms for the virus.\n",
      "“I still had a cold when I landed, but I easily passed through immigration and went home. The next day, I realised the extent of the outbreak. My office first got me tested and then reached out to the airport authorities, who directed us to Kasturba hospital,” he said. He and his colleague, a 31-year-old woman, were admitted to Kasturba hospital on January 23, while their two other colleagues were quarantined in Delhi.\n",
      "While the 36-year-old man claimed he had not come across a thermal scanner, a CSMI spokesperson said two such scanners have been positioned in aerobridges for Air China and RwandAir flights. “We direct these flights to those aerobridges. The scanner can detect high body temperature from a distance of three metres,” the spokesperson said.\n",
      "A thermal scanner is a hand-held device. At airports in other countries, each passenger is screened using the device. At the Mumbai airport, it is mounted atop a tripod and can only detect fever, but not cough and cold. “That is why we encourage self-reporting by people,” the official said, adding that more passengers in flights from Hong Kong may soon be screened.\n",
      "Till now, 4,846 passengers have been screened at the airport, but none have been referred to Kasturba hospital for quarantine. Most passengers have themselves reported to authorities a day or more after exiting the airport.\n",
      "Dr Sadhana Tayade, director of Directorate of Health Services, said she held a meeting with airport officials on Wednesday. “They have strengthened the screening system. They also plan to reach out to other airlines to make in-flight announcements for passengers to report coronavirus symptoms,” she said.\n",
      "On Thursday, as the 36-year-old man and his colleague were discharged from Kasturba hospital after a second test for the virus came negative. He later told The Indian Express that the municipal hospital had poor prevention control mechanism. “We were scared that if any patient had coronavirus, we would all be at risk. The infection would circulate within the ward,” he said.\n",
      "The hospital’s isolation unit maintains no separate air conditioning, and only has windows for ventilation. There remains no negative pressure in the ward to prevent cross-infection. The 10-bedded quarantine facility has four rooms, a bed in each, and a general ward with six beds.\n",
      "“It used to be cleaned 4-5 times a day, the staffers wore masks, but that is it,” he added.\n",
      "A state health official said Kasturba hospital has been directed by state and central governments to improve its infection prevention mechanism. Training will also be given to staffers to handle the suspected cases.\n",
      "Two foreigners admitted to Kasturba hospital\n",
      "Two foreigners were admitted at the isolation ward of Kasturba hospital on Thursday and two Indians in Pune’s Naidu hospital for suspected coronavirus infection. Across the state, 11 people remain in isolation wards.\n",

      "Tweet: Biblical scholar Rabbi Matityahu Glazerson pointed to an excerpt from the book of Leviticus that spoke about the importance of not eating impure food, and highlighted codes pointing to the virus. By JERUSALEM POST STAFF JANUARY 31, 2020 06:30 People waiting for passengers wear masks at Pearson airport arrivals, shortly after Toronto Public Health received notification of Canada's first presumptive confirmed case of coronavirus, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada January 25, 2020 (photo credit: REUTERS/CARLOS OSORIO) The coronavirus outbreak currently spreading all over the world originated in China, and many fingers have been pointed, spreading blame for the widespread infections that have currently infected over 8,000 people worldwide at the time of writing.But according to some, the global pandemic may have been foretold thousands of years ago in the Bible .According to biblical scholar Rabbi Matityahu Glazerson, the Bible codes foretold the onset of the coronavirus in its text, he explained in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel.Pointing out numerous news stories that point to the coronavirus outbreak originating from China's markets – which were reported to have included everything from rats, snakes, bats, fish and still living wolf pups – Glazerson pointed to an excerpt from the book of Leviticus that spoke about the importance of not eating impure food.There, he highlights consistent letters highlighted equidistant in the text from one another – something known as the Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS). This ELS contained the Hebrew letters kuf, reish, vav, nun and hey. Corona. He also points out other highlighted ELS instances in the same section. One spells out vav, yud, reish, vav and samech. Virus. The other spells out alef, bet, reish, mem, het and yud, which spells out the phrase Eiver Mehai , or limb from the living, which refers to the sin of eating the limb of a still-living animal.In another part of the excerpt, he highlights the letters samech, yud, nun and yud, which spells Sini , or Chinese.\"You have it exactly in the section of the Torah that says things you should not eat,\" Glazerson explained, pointing to a highlighted verse.\"I separated for you the impure things, then you will be for Me a holy people,\" he said, translating the verse.\"It's amazing finding this: Coronavirus, China and the limb from the living, which causes what we see now.\"Bible codes, also known as Torah codes, have been studied for centuries, and often rely heavily on ELS. Many scholars claim to have utilized ELS to find numerous clues hinting at future events, including predictions of 9/11 and the Holocaust.However, it is controversial and not widely accepted in both religious and scholarly circles. var cont = ` Sign up for The Jerusalem Post Premium Plus for just $5 Upgrade your reading experience with an ad-free environment and exclusive content `; document.getElementById(\"linkPremium\").innerHTML = cont; var divWithLink = document.getElementById(\"premium-link\"); if(divWithLink !== null && divWithLink !== 'undefined') { divWithLink.style.border = \"solid 1px #cb0f3e\"; divWithLink.style.textAlign = \"center\"; divWithLink.style.marginBottom = \"40px\"; divWithLink.style.marginTop = \"40px\"; divWithLink.style.width = \"728px\"; } (function (v, i){ }); Subscribe for our daily newsletter \n",

      "As the World Health Organization declares a global health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak, the University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) has established a protocol should the hospital need to treat infected patients.\n",
      "Unlike during the Ebola virus epidemic in 2014 , however, the UCMC is not one of Chicago’s designated facilities to deal with infections should they arise locally. On Thursday, UCMC Infection Control Program Director Rachel Marrs clarified that every hospital is individually capable of screening for infections.\n",
      "The UCMC is operating under criteria set by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which encompass clinical features such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing alongside epidemiological risks such travel to the disease’s epicenter, Wuhan, China. Other factors include close contact with a confirmed or an under-investigation ill person.\n",
      "Should patients meet those criteria, the UCMC would seek CDC approval to test for coronavirus and send blood and respiratory samples to CDC headquarters in Atlanta for confirmation.\n",
      "The UCMC has no designated, preemptive unit for coronavirus cases. Marrs said screening at the hospital would occur at entry points like clinical appointments or the emergency room followed by testing as necessary and finding an appropriate, nearby facility for treatment.\n",
      "“We are prepared, if we have a patient, that we could treat them here,” Marrs said, though she said any hospital could care for infected patients.\n",
      "Marrs observed that the CDC currently thinks the novel coronavirus is more contagious than SARS or MERS, which belong to the same family of viruses, but is less deadly. Nevertheless, Marrs said the new virus is still evolving and said she could not predict what the CDC would find as far as its infectability and mortality.\n",
      "The United States reported its first person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus on Jan. 30, as a woman who contracted the infection in Wuhan infected her spouse in Chicago. In a statement , Illinois Department of Public Health Director Ngozi Ezike said the risk to the general public in Illinois is low.\n",
      "“Local, state and federal health officials are working to identify those who have had close contact with the individual,” said Ezike, ordering “protective measures to minimize further spread of the virus.”\n",
      "Chicago Public Health Commissioner Allison Arwady said there is no local emergency at this time and told residents that they do not need to cancel events, avoid mass gatherings or don masks or gloves in public.\n",
      "“Currently, there’s not widespread activity,” Marrs said, adding that much depends on the result of the WHO emergency and whether more flights are canceled to and from China. “I think our response has to be based on risk to both our patients and the community.”\n",
      "In the meantime, Marrs recommended that the public follow “general good respiratory etiquette,” like covering coughs, washing hands and wearing masks in the case of sickness.\n",
      "“There’s no need to have a general concern by residents,” she said. “The activity is still very, very low, so you definitely don’t need to go buy masks for coronavirus. If you have respiratory symptoms due to any sort of virus, you’d want to wear a mask. But you don’t need to wear a mask for coronavirus.”\n",

      "Tweet: Australia c.bank to hold interest rate in Feb, next cut seen in April * reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/cb-polls?s=GCR01+2H+7&st=Menu+G+C poll data * RBA decision expected on Feb 4 at 0330 GMT By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank will likely hold its cash rate at a record low of 0.75% next week but cut at least once more later this year, a Reuters poll showed, amid signs the country's economy was still stuck in a slow lane. A majority of the 32 respondents expect the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to keep its benchmark rate at 0.75% at its Feb. 4 policy review. Most economists pushed back their prediction to April, from February, just last week after better-than-expected employment data for December. As many as 23 of 32, or nearly 72%, forecast rates at 0.5% before June with three predicting deeper cuts to 0.25%. A median of 29 respondents expects the cash rate will remain at 0.5% through end-2020 and then ease to 0.25% by early next year. Economists' predictions align with market pricing which shows little chance of a move in February. Futures are predicting a 60% chance of a cut to 0.50% in April. Australia's A$1.95 trillion ($1.33 trillion) economy is in its 29th year of recession-free expansion, the longest boom among developed countries. But economic risks have intensified over the past year, with growth slowing, inflation lukewarm and unemployment ticking higher. \"We expect that the RBA will lower its 2020 growth forecast,\" Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said in a note, predicting two cuts this year - April and August. Inflation ticked higher in the final quarter of 2019, data showed this week, though core measures remained subdued despite three interest rate cuts last year. The RBA expects the economy to start generating inflationary pressures only when unemployment falls to 4.5% or below. That could prove challenging given the jobless rate is now at 5.1% from as low as 4.9% in February. But RBA's rate cuts have so far done little to boost growth. Consumer sentiment surveys pointed to deepening pessimism in January as households fretted about the economic impact of a prolonged and devastating bushfire season that has so far killed 33 people and destroyed thousands of homes. The RBA will also provide its updated quarterly forecasts for the economy and inflation next week. Analysts expect small downgrades for near-term growth due to the impact from bushfires and a rapidly that has left parts of China in a lockdown. China is Australia's largest trading partner. \"Westpac has adjusted its GDP forecasts for the bushfire effect, lowering GDP growth in both the December and March quarters by 0.1%, reflecting the impact on tourism; agriculture; and regional retail of the bushfire crisis,\" Evans said. \"The second risk to the growth outlook is the coronavirus outbreak.

      "After he became national security adviser, John Bolton eliminated the office as part of an NSC reorganisation, as he did not see global health issues as a national security priority.\n",

      "Funding has also been cut drastically to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), forcing it to reduce or discontinue epidemic-prevention efforts in 39 out of the 49 countries it had been helping. Among the countries where CDC efforts were scaled back were Haiti, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as China, where the agency provided technical assistance.\n",

      "While it was not a huge surprise that 2019 was unable to maintain the economic and freight volume momentum seen in 2018, the outlook for 2020 is shaping up to be closer to the latter. That was the word from speakers at this week’s SMC3 JumpStart 2020 conference in Atlanta.\n",
      "Dr. Jeffrey Rosenweig, Associate Professor of Finance; Director, The Robson Program for Business, Public Policy, and Government, at Emory University, said in a presentation that when looking at the United States economy, annual GDP output hovered around 2.5% during the Presidential administration’s led by George W. Bush and Barack Obama, which have bee followed by some accelerations, at times, during Donald Trump’s time in office and were largely spurred on by tax cuts.\n",
      "But that does not come close to telling the full story, he said.\n",
      "“The current forecast is that [the economy] will still grow, nobody is forecasting a recession just yet,” he said.“But U.S. GDP may slow down to under 2%.”\n",
      "While retail sales and consumer confidence remain strong, Rosenweig said that manufacturing, a sector that, in some ways, is viewed as a proxy for freight activity, may already be falling into recession in the U.S. and in other major global economies, too.\n",
      "“It is typical that a country like ours leads the world in technology, technological process…and the same amount of workers can produce more each year as technology advances,” he said. “As the machinery and robots we are using increasingly embodies machine learning, where they learn as they go, then we will get to a world of artificial intelligence, self-driving trucks, as well as robots that are more flexible to change what they are doing maybe on assembly lines.”\n",
      "Rosenweig also touched upon the impact of the Coronavirus on the global economy, which has rattled markets and resulted in declines in airline share prices, with China-based airlines reducing capacity to main land China through March.\n",
      "Ben Hartford, transportation equity research for Robert W. Baird & Co., explained that looking back at 2019 featured weak volume trends elevated inventories, and excess supply, which all came together to plague industry fundamentals.\n",
      "“We do see evidence that this current freight cycle should bottom during 2020,” he said. “It is going to be a tough first half of the year. I don’t think trends have bottomed yet…when we talk about trends, it is about growth trends being less bad and improving as we finish out the year.”\n",
      "In 2019, Hartford said that freight volume growth deteriorated across multiple modes, with rail carloads as low as levels seen during the 2015-2016 trough, especially for industrial and intermodal loadings. And it was also the same for LTL weight-per-shipment throughout the year, and airfreight and ocean volumes, too, up against tough annual comparisons to 2018. Elevated inventories impacted by weak industrial trends also played a role as well, he said.\n",
      "“We are looking at uncertainty everyday,” he noted. “When you contract, there are a lot of contradictions in the market. There are a lot of similarities between now and the late 1990s, with weak freight trends and industrial trends and equity markets less muted. Changing trade and fiscal policies and political rhetoric stand out as similar comparisons to back then. What is different now is the limitless amount of data we have at our fingertips….makes things now more of a matter of perspective in that people can find anything they want to justify any outlandish statement they want to make. It creates a lot of noise and that noise and business uncertainty can plague future growth and from a business owner or consumer standpoint, it does have a tendency to restrict activity for capital budgets and consumer confidence weakens growth.”\n",
      "With freight growth rates expected to bottom in 2020 and a tough first half of the year expected and a pending bid season approaching, less bad growth rates are in the forecast for the back half of 2020, with the caveat that industrial activity will play a key role in whether that plays out or not, Hartford reiterated.\n",
      "From a supply standpoint, Hartford said truckload supply is expected to continue to leave the market, coupled with stabilizing demand supply reduction is expected to support load factors, utilization rates, and help support pricing growth through 2020.\n",
      "“Consumer demand remains solid, and industrial activity is showing some signs of bottoming,” he said. “The reality is it is a long cycle, a slow growth cycle. The reality is economic cycles don’t die of old age, they tend to be killed by sharp spikes in energy prices or inversions in the yield curve. We are near all-time cycle highs for consumer confidence, though. Consumer confidence tends to be the last to give up the ghost immediately before a recession. What triggers that are the sharp spikes in energy prices.” \n",

      "Tweet: Even small changes in China have global effects. Benjamin So is a 27-year-old doctor in Hong Kong. He usually works in the internal medicine department of Queen Mary Hospital, located on the southern coast of the city with sweeping views of the South China Sea. Right now, however, he’s holed up in a hotel room nearby in self-imposed quarantine—and preparing for a strike. The coronavirus epidemic is unfolding in Hong Kong at a volatile time. After months of large-scale protests , public trust in the government is at historic lows and societal divisions at record highs. Yet the current public health crisis may well transcend political divides and unite Hong Kongers in their shared anger at the perceived incompetence of the government. Earlier this week, during his shift working in the isolation ward, So admitted two elderly patients who had travelled to Hong Kong from Wuhan. The couple were later confirmed to be infected with the novel coronavirus , which has now infected almost 10,000 people in China and killed 213. Hong Kong has 12 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. This left So with a question: should he be quarantined, given his direct contact with two confirmed cases, or was he expected to return to work the next day? Hospital management, So said, told him that he would not need to isolate himself, because he had been in protective gear when dealing with the patients. So found this decision “bizarre,” because there was no way of ruling out any chance of contamination. Returning to work as usual, he thought, would only put other patients and colleagues at risk. That’s how So decided to check himself into a hotel room for at least two weeks, paying out of his own pocket for accommodation. Though management later told him that the hospital can make available 21 isolation rooms on site for medical personnel, he felt that this would still be insufficient in the event of a full-blown outbreak in Hong Kong. “I would say the Hospital Authority has been quite slow in responding to this outbreak and they haven’t had clear contingency plans…it shows how limited our resources are,” said So, referring to the government body that manages the city’s hospitals. “If a full community outbreak does happen there’s no way our medical system can deal with that.” https://twitter.com/VivienneChow/status/1220590555626762241?s=20 Now he’s spending his time in isolation, drafting statements and petitions calling for a medical strike. More than 6,500 nurses and doctors have already pledged to strike unless the government meets their demands, foremost of which is the complete closure of all 14 border control points with mainland China in order to stem the coronavirus outbreak. On Tuesday (Jan. 28), Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam ordered a partial closure of the border , but the measure was widely panned as ineffective because only about 10% of mainland Chinese visitors come through the ports of entry being shut. To many, the Hong Kong government appears unable to make its own decisions without first deferring to Beijing. When Lam announced travel restrictions for mainland Chinese visitors this week, it was presented not as Hong Kong barring entry to mainlanders, but as China suspending the issuance of individual tourist visas. When the chief secretary addressed concerns about the shortage of surgical masks, he said he had asked China to allow imports of masks into Hong Kong. And with the government’s continued refusal to close the border with China despite polling showing overwhelming public support for the measure, people are again wondering whether officials truly have the public’s interests at heart. Lam doubled down on her decision at another news conference today, arguing that measures to close the border would “ stigmatize ” mainland Chinese. “No one is asking for the border to be closed permanently,” So said. “What we’re asking for is in the interim… there’s a need to very firmly tighten up border controls so that we can limit the number of further imported cases.” And while the government has already banned entry to Hong Kong for people from Hubei province, the outbreak’s epicenter, So says this is “nowhere near enough” as the coronavirus has already spread throughout China. https://twitter.com/LeungKaiChiHK/status/1223198938494193664 Already, some 90 nurses at three hospitals called in sick earlier this week to sound the alarm ahead of the strike.“They were very concerned about the quality of our facilities and that they wouldn’t be able to protect themselves or our patients,” he said of the nurses. But he also understands that calling for medical professionals to strike can be morally fraught. The Hong Kong Public Doctors’ Association, for one, has said it would not take part in the strike . The Hospital Authority Employees’ Alliance, a newly formed union that grew out of the protest movement and that is organizing the industrial action, will vote tomorrow on whether to go on strike . The continuing resistance movement , So said, has galvanized support for protest actions like strikes. “The incentive for health care workers to go on strike is very low, there’s a lot of moral baggage we’re carrying,” So said. “But if this is the only way to force the government to take real policy action, then this is what we have to do.” He said that friends and family are also supportive of the strike because “they understand this is the last resort to force the government to take action to stop the outbreak from happening.”\n",

      "Tweet: Kamala Harris outside the Senate Chamber on Thursday. Photo: Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images For senators, an impeachment trial is a hybrid of law school and jury duty.\n",
      "They sit for countless hours. Some take neat, handwritten notes in blue ink, like Elizabeth Warren. Cory Gardner has an omnipresent pad of post-its on his desk for small-scale scribbling. Others, like Republican Richard Shelby of Alabama, watch proceedings quietly and impassively for hours at time. But whatever their process, all 100 senators must determine how to weigh the evidence presented for and against the conviction of Donald Trump.\n",
      "Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley told Intelligencer that he had already taken over 50 pages of notes. He remarked that he might have taken more but the “piles of handouts” from House managers have reduced the number that he needed to take. He planned on going through all of his notes in “a systematic process” during the 16 hours allotted for senators to ask questions.\n",
      "Merkley, a devoted player of KenKen puzzles, said that he was “more of a math guy than words guy” and planned to lay out a system to weigh the key points of each article of impeachment. The two-term senator from Oregon then said he would structure the information “so on each of those key points, what is the evidence that is brought to bear both for and against? So kind of one setup for and against.”\n",
      "Battling a bad cold, Merkley said he felt “very depleted” as a result of the long hours of the trial despite being “normally being very high-energy during the day.” To cope with this, he said, “I’m doing a fair amount of standing and I’m getting glasses of ice cubes. So I’m crunching on ice cubes.” Merkley also said that he kept “little pieces of beef jerky” in his desk drawer. The Oregon Democrat compared the ordeal to being on a long road trip. “This is what I do when I drive,” he said. “When I’m on a drive and if I’m tired, I try to have something to sip or to nibble on. It somehow just helps me. Here, in this case, it’s ice cubes and standing. “\n",
      "A non-lawyer, Merkley does have experience as juror. He served on a jury in D.C. before moving back to Oregon and seeking elected office. In the Senate, this was Merkley’s second impeachment, his first being the 2010 trial of federal judge Thomas Porteous, who was convicted of corruption and removed from office. Merkley noted that experience was “completely different — there was no partisanship. When we locked the doors and talked to each other in preparation, it was just like 100 senators with no party identity.”\n",
      "In contrast, Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, harkened back to her legal career. “I’m thinking of it in terms of the elements of the case,” and used a familiar law school approach of IRAC — issue, rule, application and conclusion — to organize her thinking about the case. Harris was able to sit back and appreciate the approach of the House managers from a technical standpoint. “They are doing it in a very logical way,” said the former California state attorney general. “I know the method that they are using. I appreciate it and I admire it.”\n",
      "Despite her courtroom experience, Harris had never sat on a jury before, so the experience is new. She described herself as an “active listener” who was “not so good sitting down for long periods” and said that she was taking an “average” amount of notes compared to her colleagues.\n",
      "Another senator with a legal background, Republican Josh Hawley of Missouri, told Intelligencer, “I’ve now been through all the briefs and responsive briefs several times.” The former law clerk for Chief Justice John Roberts said, “If you watch my desk, you’ll see staff coming because I’m requesting articles. I continue to read about impeachment, about precedent, about interpretative questions. I’ve read a lot of the cases under American law on bribery and extortion because that clearly is the Democrats’ case, what the elements are for that.“ Hawley added, “By the way, I’m confident after that [research] there simply is no legal case for bribery and extortion there, just zero.”\n",
      "Hawley did say that he had been enjoying the trial. “It’s kind of fun,” said the Missouri Republican. “I love being a lawyer and I miss the practice of law, so this kind of exciting.” He mused, “It’s the closest I’ll ever get to being a judge, I’m sure.” But Hawley didn’t need the fun to go on too much longer. “Hopefully it won’t go on for six months.”\n",

      "THURSDAY, Jan. 30, 2020 (HealthDay News) -- The World Health Organization declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak an international public health emergency on Thursday, as the United States reported its first case of person-to-person transmission of the virus.\n",
      "The declaration states that the world's top health advisory body thinks the situation is grave, The New York Times reported. Countries can then make their own decisions about closing their borders, canceling flights, screening people arriving at airports or taking other protective measures.\n",
      "In the United States, the latest coronavirus patient is the husband of a Chicago woman who was the second confirmed case in the United States. She had traveled to Wuhan , China, the epicenter of the outbreak, and fell ill upon her return home. The husband is in his 60s and has underlying health conditions, U.S. health officials said during a media briefing Thursday. Six cases of coronavirus have now been reported in the United States.\n",
      "\"This second patient [the husband] did not travel to China, indicating the first person-to-person transmission of novel coronavirus in the United States,\" said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n",
      "\"The risk to the general public in Illinois remains low,\" Ezike said during the briefing. \"This person-to-person spread was between two very close contacts, a wife and husband. The virus is not spreading widely across the community.\"\n",
      "Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , agreed.\n",
      "\"We understand this may be concerning, but based on what we know now our assessment remains that the risk to the public is low,\" Redfield said during the briefing.\n",
      "\"The vast majority of Americans have not had recent travel to China, the high-risk areas of transmission where human-to-human transmission is occurring,\" he added.\n",
      "U.S. health experts said person-to-person transmission in the United States was inevitable.\n",
      "\"The main takeaway is this confirms something we already knew: that there was likely person-to-person spread in China with this virus. Otherwise the numbers wouldn't be as high as they are,\" said Dr. Eric Cioe-Pena, director of global health at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y.\n",
      "In China, the case count kept climbing on Thursday, with cases of what is dubbed the 2019-nCoV coronavirus now reaching 8,149. The death total stands at 171, the Times reported. Those counts eclipse the 5,327 cases and 348 deaths reported in China during the 2003 SARS outbreak.\n",
      "Meanwhile, countries around the world took steps to cut the risk of the virus spreading to their citizens.\n",
      "In the United States, health officials explained on Wednesday what measures are being taken to make sure the Americans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Tuesday are not infected with the new virus.\n",
      "While none of the 195 American evacuees have shown signs of sickness, they agreed to stay at the base voluntarily, said Dr. Chris Braden, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The plan is to hold them for three days and check them for fever and other symptoms at least twice daily, CNN reported.\n",
      "\"They wanted to protect their family. They wanted to protect others,\" Braden said.\n",
      "The Trump administration also announced on Wednesday that it had formed a coronavirus task force to monitor and manage the United States' response to the outbreak. Members of the task force have met every day this week, and President Donald Trump chaired the meeting on Wednesday, U.S. health officials said.\n",
      "Managing the public health situation in China is far more challenging.\n",
      "After first declining assistance from international health officials, Chinese authorities agreed to let expert teams coordinated by the World Health Organization visit China to help stem the outbreak, the Times reported Wednesday.\n",
      "Chinese health officials have determined that people carrying the virus but not showing symptoms can still infect others. The incubation period can vary from one to 14 days, with a typical duration of about 10 days. That fact makes containment especially difficult. This was not the case with the SARS coronavirus outbreak.\n",
      "Still, China's efforts to try to contain the outbreak continue, including a travel ban that involves more than 50 million people.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Hong Kong has barred entry to visitors from Hubei province, which is at the center of the outbreak, and travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide. Airlines around the world suspended flights to China on Wednesday, and Russia closed its 2,600-mile border with China, the Times reported.\n",
      "Outside China, numerous countries have reported cases of coronavirus.\n",
      "Thailand has reported 14 cases of infection; Japan has 11; Hong Kong and Singapore have 10; Taiwan has eight; Australia, Malaysia and Macau each have seven; France has five; South Korea, Germany and the United Arab Emirates each have 4; Canada has three; Vietnam has two; and India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Finland each have one.\n",

      "India saw growth drop to 4.5% in the July-September quarter - its lowest level in 26 quarters. Consequently, the budget deficit for the upcoming fiscal year may need to exceed this year's target of 3.3% of gross domestic product, the government said in an economic survey released on Friday.\n",
      "India should rationalize food subsidies, push exports and adopt counter-cyclical fiscal policy to boost sluggish demand, Krishnamurthy Subramanian, chief economic adviser to the finance ministry, said in the report.\n",
      "But he warned that expanding fiscal deficit targets would pose a risk of \"crowding out private investments\" and slower growth in consumer demand amid continued global trade tensions.\n",
      "The government estimates gross domestic product will grow 5% this fiscal year, which ends on March 31. That would be the slowest growth since the global financial crisis of 2008-09.\n",

      "Some economists believe the survey's growth forecast is too optimistic. They point out recovery remains fragile, inflation is accelerating, and consumer demand and investments are likely to decline, even though the central bank cut interest rates by 135 basis points in 2019.\n",
      "\"The forecast could be aspirational,\" said N.R Bhanumurthy, at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy think tank.\n",

      "In an attempt to show the impact of the fall in overall inflation during the last six years with Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, the survey came up with the term \"Thalinomics - the economics of a plate of food in India.\"\n",
      "The survey said affordability of vegetarian \"thalis\", a Hindi word for a plate of food, has improved by 29% from 2006-07 to 2019-2020, and non-vegetarian \"thalis\" by 18%.\n",
      "The Modi government has touted its achievement in bringing down inflation from a 12.13% high in November 2013 to below 5%, though it has risen again and recorded a five-year high of 7.35% in December.\n",
      "The survey said the fall in food inflation has been a major contributing factor in reductions between 2014-15, when the Modi government first came to power, and 2018-19.\n",
      "However, economists point out that low core inflation, without fuel and food prices, is evidence for weak demand in the economy.\n",
      "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the budget for the coming fiscal year on Saturday.\n",
      "In it, Sitharaman is expected to announce a host of economy-reviving measures. Income tax cuts, higher spending on infrastructure and incentives for real estate are likely. So is a plan to revive stressed shadow banks.\n",
      "However, the slowdown in growth has reduced tax revenues. The government may be forced to channel its increased spending through quasi-sovereign bodies, which would not be included in its deficit calculations.\n",
      "The report gave no projection for the deficit. Economists believe that is around 3.8% for the ongoing fiscal year.\n",
      "To accommodate higher spending, the deficit might be allowed to grow to at least 3.5%, missing the 3% target for next year, sources and economists have told Reuters.\n",
      "Subramanian also said that the impact of China's fast-spreading coronavirus would be marginal on the Indian economy.\n",

      "According to the Survey, the financial flows to the economy remained constrained as credit growth declined for both banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs.)The capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) increased from 14.3 per cent to 15.1 per cent between March 2019 and September 2019.\n",
      "After significant decline since 2014-15, India's external liabilities (debt and equity) to gross domestic product (GDP) increased at the end of June 2019 primarily by an increase in FDI, portfolio flows and external commercial borrowings (ECBs), notes the Survey.\n",
      "Repo rate was cut by 110 basis points in four consecutive MPC meetings in the financial year due to slower growth and lower inflation. It was, however, kept unchanged in the fifth meeting held in December 2019.\n",
      "In 2019-20, liquidity conditions were tight for the initial two months; but subsequently, it remained comfortable.\n",
      "Gross non-performing advances ratio remained unchanged for SCBs at 9.3 per cent between March and September 2019 but increased slightly for NBFCs from 6.1 per cent in March 2019 to 6.3 per cent in September 2019.\n",
      "Public sector banks (PSBs) with about 70 per cent of the market share in Indian banking have an onus of supporting the Indian economy and fostering its economic development.\n",

The new virus, which is of the same genre as SARS which broke out in 2003, was first reported in the WHO Disease Outbreak news on January 5, 2020. It has progressively spread across many countries from its epicentre in Wuhan. Air India did such evacuation earlier also from Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Nepal. In August, 1990, Air India and erstwhile Indian Airline evacuated more than one lakh Indians from Iraq and Kuwait via 488 flights in 59 days, created world record for the largest aerial evacuation since 1948-49.

      "BOSTON (AP) — A Harvard University professor charged with lying about his role in a Chinese talent recruitment program was released from custody Thursday and ordered to post a $1 million cash bond.\n",
      "Charles Lieber appeared in Boston&apos;s federal court wearing orange jail garb and chains around his ankles two days after his arrest at his Ivy League university office, where he was chair of the chemistry and chemical biology department.\n",
      "Lieber is accused of lying about his participation in China&apos;s Thousand Talents Plan, which targets overseas scientists and researchers willing to bring their expertise to China in exchange for things like research funding and lab space.\n",
      "Prosecutors had proposed setting bond at $1.5 million secured by Lieber&apos;s suburban Boston home. But Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler instead ordered Lieber to post a $1 million cash bond by next Thursday.\n",
      "Lieber did not comment as he left the courthouse with his wife amid a throng of reporters after the hearing. His lawyers also declined to comment.\n",
      "Lieber is required to give up his passport and disclose any foreign bank accounts and is barred from talking to any potential victims or witnesses in the case, among other restrictions. His wife will also hand over her passport after prosecutors raised concerns that she could move cash to another country.\n",
      "Prosecutors say Lieber agreed to conduct research, publish articles and apply for patents on behalf of China&apos;s Wuhan University of Technology in exchange for $50,000 per month and about $150,000 in living expenses. He also received $1.5 million to establish a research lab at the Chinese university, authorities said.\n",
      "Authorities say Lieber hid his involvement in the program from Harvard and told federal investigators in 2018 that he had never been asked to participate in the program.\n",
      "Harvard officials said Tuesday that Lieber has been placed on administrative leave and that the school is “conducting its own review of the alleged misconduct.”\n",
      "Lieber has been at Harvard since 1991 and is described by his research group as a “pioneer in nanoscience and nanotechnology.” He has also won prizes for growing huge pumpkins in the backyard of his Lexington home, including a 1870-pound (850-kilogram) pumpkin in 2014, ABC News reported at the time.\n",
      "Lieber&apos;s arrest highlights the federal government&apos;s growing concern over China&apos;s efforts to steal U.S. research and technology.\n",
      "Chinese recruitment programs such as the Thousand Talents Plan have been exploited by scientists who have downloaded sensitive research files before returning to China, filed patents based on U.S. research, lied on grant applications and failed to disclose money they had received from Chinese institutions, according to a congressional report issued last fall .\n",
      "Federal prosecutors in Boston also announced charges this week against a researcher at Boston University, who is accused of concealing her ties to the Chinese military. Yanqing Ye, who prosecutors say is a lieutenant in the People’s Liberation Army, lied about her military service to get into the U.S. and researched U.S. military projects and gathered information on two U.S. scientists for the Chinese military, authorities allege.\n",

      "The WHO said late Thursday that the coronavirus outbreak was a global emergency, but calmed the markets by opposing travel restrictions. It said Chinese actions so far will \"reverse the tide\" of its spread.\n",
      "\"China’s better-than-expected expansion in its January non-manufacturing PMI, along with the concerted efforts by the authorities to contain the viral outbreak, could help push back against some of the fears surrounding the epidemic’s impact on the world’s second-largest economy,\" said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM.\n",

      "Tweet: In view of the growing global number of confirmed infections and the impossibility of completely containing the advance of the virus, the inevitable question arises: Is Latin America prepared? by anamariae By Ana María Enciso Noguera January 30, 2020\n",
      "The coronavirus epidemic is a clear cause for concern throughout the planet. Despite the fact that it belongs to a fairly large family of viruses (ranging from the common flu to the new Chinese 2019-nCoV) and that there are numerous examples of viruses that can be transmitted from animals to humans, it is rare that the virus then manages to mutate to transmit itself from a person to another.\n",
      "This has been the main cause for concern: that it might be transmitted between humans. After several reported cases of human-to-human transmission (including in the United States), the World Health Organization has declared a State of Global Emergency .\n",
      "According to the latest daily report from the World Health Organization (January 30) , to date there are 7,818 confirmed cases of contagion globally, of which 7,736 are in China, where 1,370 people are severely ill and 170 have died. There are also 12,167 more suspected but unconfirmed cases. Outside China, there are 82 confirmed cases in 18 countries.\n",
      "The current epidemic of coronaviruses is similar to two others: SARS in 2002 (also originated in China, in the province of Canton) and MERS in 2012 (which originated in Saudi Arabia). Both are forms of coronavirus that lead to severe respiratory syndromes and have been characterized by rapid transmission and high mortality. SARS, like 2019-nCoV, was a virus that originated in animals (it may have been in bats in both cases) that were then transmitted to humans.\n",
      "However, since SARS in 2002, many things have changed for the better.\n",
      "The WHO has praised the measures taken by China to contain the outbreak. Since 2002, China has strengthened its health system. Contrary to what happened at the time, China quickly made the existence of the virus public, Chinese scientists identified its genetic sequence and published it in a matter of days, allowing groups of scientists around the world to work collaboratively on developing a vaccine , a diagnostic protocol, collaborative mechanisms between reference laboratories, and several other strategies to understand the spread of the disease.\n",
      "Johns Hopkins University , for example, developed a tool for real-time mapping of coronavirus spread .\n",
      "In addition, the Chinese government has taken unprecedented steps to contain the disease, quarantining more than 30 million people; a step that, as the New York Times mentions, no American politician would have been able to take . And the construction in record time of a hospital for the treatment of those infected.\n",
      "On a global level, the hardening of the health measures has been remarkable, in some cases closing borders , at least partially. Latin America\n",
      "In the midst of this context, Latin America has some characteristics that act as protective factors. The first, and most obvious, is distance: not only are we separated by an enormous geographical distance, but direct flights between China and Latin America are very rare.\n",
      "Mexico had a direct flight passing through Tijuana, which has been cancelled .\n",
      "This necessarily means that those who arrive in Latin America after having been in China will have to go through controls at other international airports.\n",
      "People who are found to have coronavirus-like symptoms, such as fever, for example, will most likely be placed in quarantine.\n",
      "Still, as Mexican Undersecretary of Prevention and Health Promotion Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez has stated, it is very difficult to contain the disease (due to its own epidemic characteristic), so it is highly probable that sooner or later it will arrive.\n",
      "However, it is important to take into account the following factors: one, 2019-nCoV seems to be less transmissible and less lethal and two, Latin American laboratories have the capacity to detect it.\n",
      "While the current coronavirus outbreak has had a mortality rate of 2-4%, its cousins had a much higher mortality rate: 15-20% for SARS and 65% for MERS.\n",
      "With regard to Latin America's ability to detect infection in a timely manner, authorities have been confident: Marcos Espinal, director of the Pan American Health Organization's Department of Communicable Diseases and Health Analysis, told CNN en Español that most Latin American countries have sufficiently well equipped laboratories.\n",

      "Tweet: Health ministry suggests the surest temporary means of protecting Solomon Islands, all eyes on cabinet to decide\n",
      "BY ALFRED PAGEPITU\n",
      "THE Ministry of health and medical services (MHMS) has reportedly requested a temporary travel ban on incoming travellers from Wuhan or China.\n",
      "The million dollar question is whether government will endorse this.\n",
      "Senior officials within the health ministry, speaking to Island Sun in anonymity, say cabinet should view the situation as “gravely serious” because of the aggressiveness of the coronavirus and should not be complacent.\n",
      "They warn cabinet not to compare the current scenario with the recent Measles campaign, in which MHMS also requested a temporary ban on incoming travels but was rejected by the Attorney General before their submission could even make it to cabinet.\n",
      "Health officials say process to detect the coronavirus is made complicated by the fact that carriers do not often display symptoms for few days, hence would pass detection processes in airports or ports.\n",
      "Island Sun understands that cabinet met yesterday to deliberate on the submission by MHMS on the China coronavirus; a decision was yet to be made known when this paper went to print last night.\n",
      "Members of public have also taken their concerns to social media, some having turned up at the Island Sun office to express their fears and concerns that current measures may not be enough to keep out the China coronavirus.\n",
      "They also share the same idea that a temporary travel ban be imposed on inbound vessels and planes.\n",
      "However, skeptic health officials tell Island Sun that regarding their temporary travel ban request for the Measles outbreak, the Attorney General had turned down the suggestion citing several reasons.\n",
      "Loss of business to aviation, airlines and seaports, and such, were some of the reasons stated and other reasons were financial loss to SIG due to travelers claiming compensation for flight and travel disruptions.\n",
      "“AG also highlighted that our current legislation does not protect or make SIG immune to any compensation claimants or such, in such a travel ban scenario,” the health officials say.\n",
      "Island Sun understands that the meeting yesterday included Government ministries such as the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Communications and Aviation, Immigrations, the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), the National Security and including UNICEF and WHO. The briefing was to ensure all responsible stakeholders are well coordinated and are prepared to respond to the emerging threat of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to Solomon Islands.\n",
      "Ministry of health is working closely with all health departments responsible for different clusters on daily basis. Daily meetings and debriefings are conducted to assess actions and monitor implementation of next actions \n",

      "Tweet: Inside the Market’s roundup of some of today’s key analyst actions Inside the Market’s roundup of some of today’s key analyst actions Though its fourth-quarter results fell short of his expectations, RBC Dominion Securities analyst Paul Quinn upgraded Resolute Forest Products Inc. ( RFP-N , RFP-T ) on Friday, seeing its current valuation providing an “attractive” entry point for investors “given our expectation that many of Resolute’s end-markets are at or near their cyclical lows.”\n",
      "\"Nearly all of Resolute’s core businesses have faced very difficult operating conditions over the last year, which, combined with negative news flow, have pushed Resolute’s share price near its all-time lows,\" said Mr. Quinn in a research note released before the bell.\n",
      "\"However, there are some green shoots. We think lumber is well positioned heading into the spring building season. Pulp markets have tightened, and we see limited risk of further price reductions. Finally, weakness in newsprint and specialty paper markets is likely to prompt a supply-side response (i.e., capacity reduction), in our view. We see the risk-reward as favorable given that the majority of the downside seems currently priced into Resolute’s shares.\"\n",
      "Moving its stock to “outperform” from “sector perform,” Mr. Quinn said he expects Resolute’s Wood Products segment to show “significant” improvement in 2020, pointing to an \" attractive near-term outlook for the North American lumber business and new exposure to the U.S. South.\"\n",
      "He also sees pulp markets poised for a turnaround, however he expressed concern about the impact coronavirus fears on demand.\n",

      "Equity analysts at Desjardins Securities increased their oil price deck for 2020 and 2021 in a research report released Thursday afternoon, expressing concern that the market has been slow to factor in “omnipresent geopolitical risk in the Middle East.”\n",
      "“The new decade started with a major geopolitical disturbance following a series of events in Iraq which pushed the U.S. and Iran to the brink of a direct military conflict. With regard to oil prices, the limp response to the saga represented the third major failed attempt to reintroduce a geopolitical risk premium in response to simmering tensions in the Persian Gulf,” said Justin Bouchard, Chris MacCulloch and Scott Van Bolhuis.\n",
      "“Recall that the drums of war initially began beating during last summer’s tanker wars near the Strait of Hormuz and the downing of a US military drone by Iran, the retaliatory air strikes for which President Trump called off in the final moments before the mission was executed. This was later followed up by the September attack on the Saudi Aramco Abqaiq and Khurais oil fields, which the kingdom asserted was orchestrated by Iran, an allegation that found support from the U.S. and other western intelligence agencies. Then, on January 3, the U.S. military launched a drone strike in Baghdad which killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was followed by an Iranian retaliatory attack on two US military bases in Iraq. Both sides ultimately stepped back from the brink by opting to de-escalate the conflict, which drove a sharp drop in global oil prices. The limp market response to these recent events in the Persian Gulf suggests that the market will likely need to see the equivalent of ‘boots on the ground’ at this point to spur a meaningful geopolitical risk premium.”\n",
      "They also noted the headwinds stemming from the coronavirus outbreak, though they think it will likely prove to be a short-term obstacle.\n",
      "“We continue to see support for oil prices arising from simmering tensions in the Persian Gulf in tandem with decelerating U.S. production growth and deeper OPEC+ supply cuts, which we now expect to be rolled over beyond the March deadline,” they said.\n",
      "Growing more constructive on oil market fundamentals, they raised their WTI price forecast to US$60 per barrel in 2020 (from US$55l) and US$57.50 in 2021 (from US$55). That increase, coupled with a rise in their natural gas price assumptions, led them to make several target price adjustments to stocks in their coverage universe ahead of fourth-quarter earnings season.\n",

That said, CNQ combines discipline with unparalleled growth optionality across its asset base while SU generates robust FCF across a range of commodity price scenarios owing to its integrated business model. We also believe that OVV (previously Encana Corporation) offers a unique value proposition, trading below Canadian and US peers while having geographical diversification and a growing FCF profile.”\n",

      "RBC Dominion Securities analyst Steve Arthur expects to see “solid” growth from CAE Inc. ( CAE-T , CAE-N ) when it releases its third-quarter financial results on Feb. 7 before the bell.\n",
      "Led by its Civil segment, Mr. Arthur is projecting revenue growth of 13 per cent-year over-year. He's also anticipating segment margin recovery in its Defence unit.\n",
      "“Broadly, we expect trends to continue for moderate high single-digit revenue growth, improving margins, contained Capex, solid cash generation to reduce leverage, and gradually improving ROCE [return on capital employed],” he said.\n",
      "Mr. Arthur is also anticipating further comment on CAE’s role in providing simulators and training to support the return of Boeing Co. 's ( BA-N ) 737 Max.\n",
      "“CAE has (deservedly in our view) received much press in recent weeks following Boeing’s comments proposing mandatory simulator training for 737 MAX pilots as part of that aircraft’s return to flight,\" he said. “As of last quarter, CAE had 48 orders for MAX simulators (we understand roughly half now delivered), along with capacity in its training network for MAX education. Of course CAE can’t get ahead of announcements from Boeing and the regulators, but we expect further discussion on CAE’s order flow, manufacturing and training capacity to address the anticipated MAX near-term demand surge.”\n",
      "“We clearly expect incremental demand for CAE, but quantifying the sustainable opportunity from MAX training is a challenge. For some context, we estimate that an incremental 10 simulator units would add 5-10 cents to EPS, presumably not a recurring annual event. 5 simulators added to the training network at high utilization might add another 5-10 cents. With the shares up $5.00 since MAX discussion became mainstream news, a good measure of the incremental earnings potential appears to be reflected.\"\n",
      "Calling it an “attractive long-term holding,” Mr. Arthur maintained an “outperform” rating with a target of $41, rising from $39. The average is $37.44.\n",
      "Following the release of better-than-anticipated first-quarter results on Thursday, Canaccord Genuity analyst Robert Young raised his financial expectations for Real Matters Inc. ( REAL-T ), expecting “strength” to continue given “a persisting” low interest rate environment.\n",
      "“Real Matters continues to win new business (four Top100s in Title in the quarter) – despite lenders being preoccupied managing mortgage volumes, suggesting pent-up demand,” the analyst said. “Management stated that the pipeline is robust, making us confident in continued share gains, which should mitigate market cycle risk in the long run,” he said.\n",
      "Maintaining a “buy” rating, Mr. Young hiked his target to $17 from $14. The average on the Street is $15.64.\n",
      "“We have adjusted our estimates post the quarter to reflect improved macro market data and positive results in FQ1,” he said. “With mortgage market tailwinds expected to continue in FQ2, we have revised our estimates upward and increased adj EBITDA margins to reflect the business’ operating leverage. We remain cautious on the forecast accuracy through F2021E and beyond, given the direct relationship with the cyclical mortgage market. We remain confident that Real Matters’ solution will continue to gain share, which may limit the impact of future interest rate hikes and/or mortgage market pullbacks.”\n",
      "Elsewhere, calling it a “standout” quarter, Raymond James analyst Steven Li increased his target to $16 from $13 with an “outperform” rating (unchanged).\n",
      "In response to a “solid clean” second-quarter earnings beat, Raymond James analyst Steven Li increased his target price for shares of Open Text Corp. ( OTEX-Q , OTEX-T ) to US$54 from US$48, keeping an “outperform” rating. The average on the Street is US$48.54.\n",
      "“OTEX printed a revenue/EPS beat for its F2Q20 with solid positive organic growth (two quarters in a row),” said Mr. Li. “The Carbonite transaction has closed and is expected to be modestly accretive in its first stub year and then fully on OTEX operating model exiting F2021. Our forecasts and target price are moving up as a result. Historically, large transactions have tended to drive share price momentum for OTEX and Carbonite is their second-largest acquisition.”\n",
      "Citi analyst Jazon Bazinet sees two risks facing Twitter Inc. ( TWTR-N ).\n",
      "Upon assuming coverage of the stock, he said the Street's revenue estimates for the social media company are too high beyond 2020, while its cost projections are likely too low.\n",
      "\"A large portion of Twitter’s historical revenue growth has stemmed from converting monthly active users to daily active users,\" he said. \"However, the revenue per DAU has not increased materially over the last four years. While Twitter can continue to migrate MAUs to DAUs, there are limits. If Twitter matches best-in-class MAU to DAU conversion (Facebook is at 65 per cent), it suggests a revenue ‘ceiling’ of about $5 billion per annum. The Street’s forecast eclipses this ceiling in 2023. As such, we expect reductions to the Street’s revenue outlook in 2021 and 2022 as the potential revenue ceiling approaches.\n",
      "“The Street expects D&A and SBC costs to represent just 20 per cent of revenues by 2022. However, Twitter’s own outlook suggests these two items will likely reflect 23 per cent to 30 per cent of revenues. In addition, academic studies suggest Twitter has not made any progress limiting the distribution of misinformation (‘fake news’). Facebook, on the other hand, has made material improvements. But, Facebook has materially stepped up investments to achieve this. For Twitter, the Street assumes opex per DAU will remain relatively flattish at Twitter over the next three years. This may be too bullish.”\n",
      "Given his projections for Twitter’s revenue fall short of the consensus estimate and his expense projection exceeds it, Mr. Bazinet set a “neutral” rating coverage for its stock.\n",
      "He lowered the firm’s target for Twitter shares to US$35 from US$36. The average on the Street is US$34.10.\n",
      "\"We will reassess our rating once Street estimates more closely reflect the likely trajectory of the financials,\" he said.\n",
      "At the same time, Mr. Bazinet assumed coverage of a pair of other companies.\n",
      "He gave Pinterest Inc. ( PINS-N ) a “buy” rating and US$30 target. The average on the Street is US$26.29.\n",
      "“We like the Pinterest for three reasons: First, there is a large opportunity to more effectively monetize non-U.S. users. Second, the Street’s 2020 estimates look reasonable to us. Third, the firm’s valuation looks compelling,” the analyst said.\n",
      "Mr. Bazinet set a “neutral” rating and US$20 target for Snap Inc. ( SNAP-N ). The average target is US$19.18.\n",
      "“The company has experienced a robust recovery since 4Q18,” he said. “User growth and revenue growth have both reaccelerated. And, this year, the firm may generate positive Adjusted EBITDA and FCF for the first time.”\n",
      "“We like the social media sector. And, Snap is performing quite well. However, we believe that there is risk to the Street’s 2021 and 2022 estimates for both revenues and adj. EBITDA. That keeps us on the sidelines.”\n",

      "New Delhi, Feb 1 (PTI) Air India's jumbo B747 plane took off from the Wuhan airport in the early hours of Saturday for Delhi, evacuating 324 Indian nationals from China as the neighbouring country continued to deal with the outbreak of novel coronavirus, said officials. \"With 324 passengers, special flight has taken off for India from Wuhan. It may reach Delhi at 7.30am,\" said an Air India spokesperson at 1.19 am on Saturday. There are five doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital and one paramedical staff on board, said the Air India spokesperson. The flight had departed from Delhi airport at 1.17 pm on Friday to evacuate Indian nationals from China, where more than 200 people - none of them Indian - have died due to novel coronavirus. On Friday evening, the Air India spokesperson had stated that another special flight may take off from Delhi airport on Saturday to evacuate Indians from Wuhan. About Friday's flight, the spokesperson had said earlier during the day, \"A team of five doctors from RML hospital, one paramedical staff from Air India, with prescribed medicines from doctors, masks, overcoats, packed food are in the aircraft. A team of engineers, security personnel are also there in this special aircraft. Whole rescue mission is being lead by Captain Amitabh Singh, Director (Operations), Air India.\" The spokesperson had added that there were five cockpit crew members and 15 cabin crew members on Friday's flight. Before departure at Delhi airport on Friday morning, Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had said, \"No service will take place in the plane. Whatever food is there will be kept in seat pockets. As there will be no service, there will be no interaction (between cabin crew and passengers).\" \"Masks have been arranged for the crew and passengers. For our crew, we have also arranged a complete protective gear,\" he had added. \"Total five doctors from the Health Ministry are also going... The plane will be there (at Wuhan airport) for 2-3 hours,\" Lohani had said. Air India has done such evacuations earlier also from countries such as Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Nepal.

      "Tweet: Bill Gates predicted a coronavirus-like outbreak – down to it starting at a Chinese market – in 2019 Netflix documentary show ‘The Next Pandemic’ Bill Gates appeared in Netflix ‘Explained’ series to discuss risks of viral spread The billionaire said world is ill-prepared to deal with global pandemic Microsoft tycoon predicted virus outbreak would begin in wet market in China By Corazon Miller For Mailonline Published: 09:56 GMT, 31 January 2020 | Updated: 17:14 GMT, 31 January 2020 In a 2019 Netflix documentary, billionaire Bill Gates predicted a killer virus could originate in China’s wet markets to rapidly infect the world In what now appears to be an eerie premonition of future events, the Microsoft tycoon warned in an episode of the Netflix ‘Explained’ series that the world was ill-prepared to deal with a global pandemic. In the series aired late last year Mr Gates had warned of the likelihood of a virus breaking out in one of China’s wet markets – exactly like the one in Wuhan where this new outbreak of Coronavirus is believed to have originated. Bill Gates featured in this episode of the ‘Explained’ series to discuss the likelihood of a killer virus going global Billionaire Bill Gates appeared in the Netflix documentary to talk about the likelihood of a virus breaking out in one of China’s wet markets where animals are killed on the spot before being sold In the episode titled ‘The Next Pandemic’ the documentary producers go to a wet market in Lianghua, China, where animals are killed and the resulting meat sold in the same place. This, the documentary explained, makes the wet markets a ‘disease X factory’ as the different animal corpses are stacked on top of each other, blood and meat mixing, before being passed from human to human. ‘All the while, their viruses are mixing and mutating, increasing the odds that one finds its way to humans,’ the documentary goes on to explain. In the episode, Mr Gates also warned the world was ill-prepared to deal with the implications of the viral spread of disease when cures were often years away. He said if nothing was done to better prepare for pandemics the time would come when the world would look back and wish it had invested more into potential vaccines. ‘If you think of anything that could come along that would kill millions of people, a pandemic is our greatest risk,’ he said. Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team drive their vehicle as they leave the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan. This is believed to be the source of the coronavirus outbreak Workers in protective gear catch a giant salamander that was reported to have escaped from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in central China’s Hubei Province. Wet markets such as this one in Wuhan which has been closed have been described as having conditions rife for a viral outbreak Scientists who have been looking at the current coronavirus outbreak believe it comes from snakes and bats – animals that had been sold live at the Wuhan seafood market, before being killed and eaten. Previous pandemics have also originated in China, such as the SARS outbreak that came from bats and civet cats. And as the World Health Organisation classes the latest coronavirus outbreak as a global health emergency, the race is on to find a vaccine. The number of cases have been rapidly growing each day and the death toll has surpassed 200. Scientists in Hong Kong and China are reportedly close to finding a vaccine and testing it for use. :\n",

      "Tweet: The Senate has directed its Committees on Petroleum Resources to investigate the expenditure of over $396million on the Turnaround Maintenance (TAM) of the nation’s four refineries between 2013 and 2015. This move followed a motion titled: “The moribund refineries in the country,” sponsored by Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf, representing Taraba Central Senatorial District. Yusuf, in his lead debate, noted that the country has four petroleum refineries with two located in Port Harcourt and one each in Kaduna and Warri, respectively. He noted that the refineries were established to adequately supply and serve needs for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK), Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), Low Pour Fuel Oil (LPFO), High Pour Fuel Oil (HPFO) and Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK) for both local consumption and exports. He lamented that despite the alleged spending of $396million for TAM of the refineries between 2013 and 2015 there is no tangible result to show in terms of local production. He insisted that the amounts being expended on TAM of the refineries in the last 25 years notwithstanding, Nigeria is still solely dependent on importation of petroleum products for domestic use. He said that the country will likely slide into recession once again if the humongous amount for TAM is added to the huge ‘under recoveries’ presently being incurred by the NNPC in the importation of petroleum products, put at over N123.25billion. “The country through NNPC has in the past 25 years spent billions of US dollars in Turnaround Maintenance of the refineries, the latest being over $396million spent between 2013 and 2015 without meaningful result,” Yusuf said. He added that “the refineries have remained in moribund state in the last 15-20 years and is almost reaching total collapse due to lack of proposer maintenance of the facilities with a poor average capacity utilization hovering between 15 percent and 25 percent per annum.” Senator Yusuf said “despite the huge spending on turn-around Maintenance of refineries, NNPC recently announced a cumulative loss of N123.25billion in 10 months (January to October, 2019), putting the total revenue of facilities at N68.82billion, while total expenses incurred was N192.1billion within the same period.” He warned that “such huge wastage and slippages amidst the nation’s tight economy, if not addressed, may lead the country back to recession.” “Such losses, when averted and combined with the huge expenditures in ‘under recovery’ on fuel pump price and properly channelled into full rehabilitation and construction of modern refineries, would positively impact on the economy and save the country from the embarrassment of importation of petroleum products and its ripple effect,” he said. In his contribution, Senator Ibikunle Amosun (Ogun Central) said one of the challenges confronting the country is lack of maintenance culture. He said it was not the first time attention was being drawn to the near collapse of the refineries in the country. He urged his colleagues to do a thorough job during the investigation process. “Oil should be a blessing to us but in Nigeria, it makes a lot of establishments lazy. We should be concern about it. “The refineries are bad and people are now taking the crude outside the country and bringing back refined products to the country on exorbitant prices,” Amosun said. In its resolutions mandated the Committee on Petroleum Downstream, Upstream and Gas to carry out a holistic investigation on the Turnaround Maintenance expenditures and the current state of the refineries as well as convoke stakeholders’ conference with the aim of finding ways to revamp them. Meanwhile, worried by the recent outbreak of the deadly disease – Coronavirus in China, which has spread quickly to some other countries, the Senate, yesterday, advised the Federal Ministry of Aviation to immediately take steps to ensure that all persons arriving from China, especially Chinese citizens, be self-isolated for, at least, two weeks to ascertain their health status before mixing up with the public. The Senate also extended the call for self-isolation to travellers from other countries that had recorded incidents of the infection. The upper chamber also advised the Nigerians who intend to travel to Asian countries to put all arrangements on hold until the Coronavirus outbreak is eliminated. The lawmakers further called on the Federal Government to allocate more funds to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to enable it be at its best to ensure the safety of the people. These resolutions, among others, came sequel to the consideration of a motion titled: “Coronavirus Outbreak and Preventive Response Towards Stemming it’s Spread in Nigeria”, sponsored by Senator Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu North). Utazi, in his presentation, explained that the virus was spread through the air by coughing or sneezing, close personal contact, touching a contaminated object or surface, and rarely by facial contamination. He added that the human Coronavirus was previously reported to cause severe symptoms such as acute respiratory syndrome, following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) outbreak that began in Wuhan, China. Utazi recalled that in response to the outbreak of the killer virus, “China put millions of people in three of its cities on lockdown in an effort to contain a Coronavirus outbreak that has killed 170 and infected more than 7,000 persons.” According to him, “Health officials fear the number of infected people will rise rapidly as hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel within China and abroad during the weeklong Lunar New Year which begin on Saturday.” The lawmaker commended the efforts already being made by the Federal Ministry of Health through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in monitoring the outbreak of the respiratory tract infection caused by the Coronavirus. According to him, the aviation regulatory agencies recently stepped up surveillance across operating airlines and international airports nationwide, as well as issued a travel advisory in a bid to contain any case of the Coronavirus pandemic. In his contribution to the motion, Senator James Manager (Delta South), raised alarm that Nigeria and other countries are at risk of experiencing an outbreak given what he described as the uncontrolled influx of Chinese nationals from one country to another. Manager, who likened the Coronavirus to the deadly Ebola virus, urged Nigerian authorities to rise to the occasion, warning that “almost all powerful countries in the world are already affected.” In his remarks, Senator Jibrin Barau (Kano North), described the motion as a wake-up call for health officials across the country to deploy early preventive measures. His words, “I was thinking whether our health officials are doing everything possible to prevent the coming of this disease into the country. “This motion is a wake-up call to our health officials to deploy preventive measures. “We should find a way to send a message through this motion to make sure the proper thing is done to a safeguard the health of citizens and the nation,” the lawmaker advised. While the lawmakers advised Nigerians to maintain good personal hygiene by constantly washing their hands with water and soap or through the use of liquid sanitizers, they also urged Nigerians with any reported cases of likely infection or with symptoms similar to those associated with Coronavirus to visit hospitals for urgent health check.\n",

      "Tweet: By EAST AFRICA CORRESPONDENT 31.01.2020. 13:24 ADDIS ABABA - Ethiopian Airlines will not suspend flights to China despite the Coronavirus scare, state media FANA said, amidst claims that the carrier had shutdown operations. Social media reports indicated the fastest growing African carrier had cancelled flights, leaving thousands stranded across the globe. China is battling Coronavirus pandemic, which has so far left over 200 people dead. About 9,000 cases of infections have been discovered, Chinese media said. Amid the pandemic, various governments are evacuating their citizens to safety, with suspension of flights being among emergency options, Reuters said. Flights not suspended Tewolde Gebremariam, the airline's CEO, on Thursday denied the reports on alleged suspension of flights, adding that all five gateways to China were open. “We are operating our regular flights to all of our five gateways in with the usual supply and demand adjustment that we always make during the Chinese New Year Holidays,\" he said. The airline makes stopovers at China, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Hong Kong among others, FANA reported. China remains one of the strongest and oldest market for Ethiopian Airlines, he said, adding that the trips will go on until advised to the contrary. For the last decade, the Chinese have flooded African market, and the Ethiopian Airline has remained an integral partner, Mirror reported. \"We have been connecting the great Chinese nation with the entire continent of African for the almost half a century and it is our growth strategic market,” he said. Ethiopia working with Chinese authorities The virus has been reported in various towns in the Communist state, causing a global health scare in the past few weeks. But various guidelines have been put in place to prevent the spreading, with World Health Organization playing a fundamental role. The CEO added: “We are also working together with all relevant Chinese and Ethiopian Authorities to protect our passengers.\" He extended his gratitude to the people and the government of China for their unreserved support and added “we would like to reassure our full commitment to stand with them at all times.” Travel restrictions around the world But with Ethiopian Airlines remaining optimistic, their Kenyan counterparts KQ on Friday suspended flights to the Chinese's Guangzhou city. Elsewhere, State Department issued travel advisory to her citizens, banning them from visiting China until the pandemic is contained, NYT reports. The department set the new advisory at Level 4, or red — its highest alert, reserved for the most perilous situations. “Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice,” the State Department said. Schools close down in China Chinese schools and universities have extended their holidays to help contain the coronavirus. Foreign students in China are leaving in droves. Some American and Australian universities have restricted travel to China. China’s education ministry ordered schools and universities to lengthen their winter holidays, though it was left to each province to decide on dates. In Hong Kong, a semiautonomous region, a few universities have suspended classes until March 2, and local news media reported that primary and secondary schools would do the same, along with kindergartens.

      "Tweet: Home / Stock Picks / Stock Market Today / 3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Lyft, HD Supply, and Melco Resorts & Entertainment 3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Lyft, HD Supply, and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Friday's big stock charts feature three names with the potential for a breakout or at least a bounce By Vince Martin , InvestorPlace Contributor Jan 31, 2020, 6:58\n",
      "The big stock charts featured this week have mostly been cautious at best. Owing to skittish broad market trading amid coronavirus fears, the focus mostly has been on stocks with potential downside, particularly if U.S. stocks began a long-awaited correction. Source: Shutterstock\n",
      "But it’s worth remembering that the financial news of the past few sessions hasn’t been that bad. Equities showed strength on Thursday, with all three major indices rallying into the close to post solid gains for the day. Those indices still are not far from all-time highs.\n",
      "Underlying performance continues to be reasonably strong. Indeed, the three most valuable U.S. companies have posted impressive results this week, assuming Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) passes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for third place. And Amazon likely will move in behind Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) after a blowout fourth quarter report on Thursday afternoon.\n",
      "In that vein, Friday’s big stock charts take a more optimistic perspective, focusing on names with potential upside ahead. Two of these stocks have attractive technical setups. Another has room for a bounce after support held. As always, broad market sentiment has to cooperate. But investors looking for trades with upside should take a long look at these three charts. Lyft (LYFT) Source: Provided by Finviz\n",
      "Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT ) stock has struggled since its initial public offering ten months ago. And no doubt many investors remain deeply skeptical of the ride-sharing model.\n",
      "But the first of Friday’s big stock charts shows an attractive technical setup and a potential catalyst looming just a week and a half out: Resistance has held for LYFT stock around current levels going back to September, but the lows since then have moved higher. That creates a classic ascending triangle and suggests momentum is building as the stock tries to clear resistance. Shares clearly have exited a downtrend, even posting a bit of a reversal from a modestly narrowing descending wedge. Simply put, this is an attractive chart right now. The fundamental case for LYFT might seem less bullish. After all, the company remains unprofitable even on an Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) basis. True net profitability might not arrive until 2023. But as I detailed just this week, Lyft has a more intriguing case than one might think. Performance over the past few quarters has been hugely impressive relative to expectations. And yet Lyft shares have lagged those of rival Uber (NYSE: UBER ), whose 2019 performance has been uneven and whose stock is more expensive. Combine another earnings beat with the chart and the fundamentals and LYFT has a real chance to break out. If Lyft can post another beat when it reports fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 11, the chart is set up for a nice post-earnings rally. Of course, that’s a big ‘if,’ and LYFT has struggled despite topping analyst expectations in each of its first three quarters. With a cheaper price and a better chart, however, this time might be different. HD Supply (HDS) Source: Provided by Finviz\n",
      "HD Supply (NASDAQ: HDS ) has a similar chart, but with one key difference: it looks like the breakout has begun. The second of our big stock charts looks bullish, and the industrial distributor has a solid fundamental case as well: HDS stock has formed an ascending triangle and on Thursday managed to break through resistance to a six-month high. It’s possible that the stock will dip back below the key level of $41. But HDS has seen solid volume in three straight green sessions, with particularly heavy buying yesterday. Moving averages have converged, setting up a “golden cross” as well. This simply looks like a stock ready to take off. From a valuation perspective, there’s plenty of reason for optimism as well. HDS stock trades at a little over 13x fiscal 2021 (ending January) earnings per share estimates. Other industrial distributors like W.W. Grainger (NYSE: GWW ) and Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST ) have far higher multiples. HD Supply is separating into two public companies in a bid to close that valuation gap which could create a near- to mid-term opportunity. There are risks. Most notably, both technically and fundamentally HDS needs external conditions to stay positive. But HD Supply stock looks like an intriguing trade for market bulls who are wary of owning an unprofitable name like LYFT. Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) Source: Provided by Finviz\n",
      "Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ: MLCO ) unsurprisingly has had a rough couple of sessions. The company’s casino operations in Macau are under significant threat from the spread of coronavirus in China and Asia more broadly.\n",
      "But as the third of Friday’s big stock charts shows, there is hope for a reversal: Simply put, buyers stepped in. Support at this point has been confirmed repeatedly at $19. That level doesn’t suggest zero downside from Thursday’s close, but traders looking to play the range might well see MLCO as having a favorable risk/reward setup at this point. Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz Taking the longer view, the case does seem a bit weaker. Like larger rivals Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS ) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN ), MLCO has traded sideways going back to 2013, albeit with a lot of volatility. Investors who believe the recent sell-off is overdone might well look to those larger names instead. But MLCO is a purer play on Macau than either Sands or Wynn, who have significant operations elsewhere. It’s too early to argue that MLCO, this time, is set for a consistent and sustainable rally. But it seems pretty clear that, at least for now, investors are willing to step into any declines under $20. That makes MLCO one of the more interesting buys for investors who believe coronavirus fears are overdone — and for traders who see a reversal on the way.\n",

      "The advice comes as hundreds of properties remain available via the room-booking platform in Wuhan, part of China’s central Hubei province, where the deadly virus is believed to have originated.\n",

The process is similar for hotels and their relationships with sites like Booking.com. A search for a place to stay in Wuhan on Booking.com using a U.K.-based computer website produces a wide range of hotel options. However, there was confusion over whether hotels were open for business.\n",

      "Pilots and flight attendants are demanding airlines stop flights to China as health officials declare a global emergency over the rapidly spreading coronavirus, with American Airlines’ pilots filing a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt.\n",
      "China has reported nearly 10,000 cases and 213 deaths, but the virus has spread to 18 countries, mostly, presumably, by airline passengers.\n",
      "The United States has advised its citizens not to travel to China, raising its warning to the same level as those for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n",
      "US airlines, which have been reducing flights to China this week, were reassessing flying plans as a result, according to people familiar with the matter.\n",
      "It is possible the White House could opt to take further action to bar flights to China in coming days, but officials stressed that no decision has been made.\n",
      "The Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents American Airlines pilots, cited “serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus” in a lawsuit filed in Texas, where the airline is based.\n",
      "American said it was taking precautions against the virus but had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. On Wednesday, it announced flight cancellations from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai, but is continuing flights from Dallas.\n",
      "APA President Eric Ferguson urged pilots assigned to US-China flights to decline the assignment. In a statement, the American Airlines’ flight attendants union said they supported the pilots’ lawsuit and called on the company and the U.S. government to “err on the side of caution and halt all flights to and from China.”\n",
      "Pilots at United Airlines, the largest US airline to China, concerned for their safety will be allowed to drop their trip without pay, according to a Wednesday memo from their union to members.\n",
      "United announced on Thursday another 332 US-China flight cancellations between February and March 28, though it will continue operating round trip flights from San Francisco to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n",
      "The American Airlines pilot lawsuit came as an increasing number of airlines stopped their flights to mainland China, including Air France KLM SA, British Airways, Germany’s Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic.\n",
      "Other major carriers have kept flying to China, but protective masks and shorter layovers designed to reduce exposure have done little to reassure crews.\n",
      "‘COUNTDOWN’ A US flight attendant who recently landed from one major Chinese city said a big concern is catching the virus and spreading it to families, or getting quarantined while on a layover. “I didn’t understand the gravity of the situation until I went there,” she said on condition of anonymity, describing general paranoia on the return flight, with every passenger wearing a mask.\n",
      "“Now I feel like I’m on a 14-day countdown.”\n",
      "Thai Airways is hosing its cabins with disinfectant spray between China flights and allowing crew to wear masks and gloves.\n",
      "Delta Air Lines is operating fewer flights and offering food deliveries so crew can stay in their hotels. The carrier is also allowing pilots to drop China trips without pay, a memo from its union to members said.\n",
      "Korean Air Lines Co Ltd and Singapore Airlines are sending additional crew to fly each plane straight back, avoiding overnight stays.\n",
      "The South Korean carrier also said it was loading protective suits for flight attendants who might need to take care of suspected coronavirus cases in the air.\n",
      "Airlines in Asia are seeing a big drop in bookings along with forced cancellations because of the coronavirus outbreak, the head of aircraft lessor Avolon Holdings Ltd said, adding the impact could last for some months.\n",
      "The outbreak poses the biggest epidemic threat to the airline industry since the 2003 SARS crisis, which led to a 45% plunge in passenger demand in Asia at its peak in April of that year, analysts said.\n",
      "Fitch Ratings said airlines with more moderate exposure to China and the Asia-Pacific region were likely to be able to re-deploy capacity to alternative routes to mitigate the effect on traffic, but that could increase competition on those routes and reduce airfares.\n",
      "Air France, which maintained China flights throughout the SARS epidemic, suspended its Beijing and Shanghai flights on Thursday after cabin crews demanded an immediate halt.\n",
      "“When the staff see that other airlines have stopped flying there, their reaction is ‘Why are we still going?’,” said Flore Arrighi, president of UNAC, one of the airline’s four main flight attendants’ unions. --reuters-- \n",

      "Prior to the outbreak, forecasts for the world’s largest auto market this year had ranged from mild sales growth to small declines after two painful years of contraction due to a slowing economy, the U.S.-China trade war and the chaotic introduction of new emission rules.\n",
      "Cui Dongshu, secretary general at the China Passenger Car Association, said his prediction for industry-wide sales growth of 1% this year now “under some pressure”.\n",
      "The holiday extension has discouraged dealers from ordering new cars from manufacturers at the end of the month as is their usual practice, virtually guaranteeing a decline in wholesale auto sales figures for January.\n",
      "“Although sales volumes in the first three weeks of January were okay, there was no ‘sales sprint’ at the end of the month. So it is inevitable that we will see a significant sales drop,” Cui said in a blog post.\n",
      "The big unknown is, however, just how far the outbreak, which authorities have said they expect to peak in February, will ravage Chinese consumer spending.\n",
      "Industry officials and analysts agree car sales will be hit in the short-term but also say the impact might not be too bad over the whole year.\n",
      "The outbreak could even change the mindset of the Chinese consumer towards car ownership, given that many are suffering in areas where public transport has been suspended, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.\n",
      "“It is hard to predict its impact in the longer term. Customers who do not have their own car might realize they need one which might help sales this year,” he said.\n",
      "Automakers with plants in Hubei, particularly in its capital Wuhan, which has seen its transport links cut off as part of a lock down to curb the virus, will have the most work to do in rejigging production plans.

      "GENEVA — The World Health Organization declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in China that has been exported to more than a dozen countries as a global emergency Thursday after the number of cases spiked more than tenfold in a week.\n",
      "The U.N. health agency defines an international emergency as an \"extraordinary event\" that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.\n",
      "China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.\n",
      "Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and have noted with concern instances in other countries — including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.\n",
      "Speaking to reporters in Geneva, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside China.\n",
      "The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries, he said. \"\"Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.\"\n",
      "\"This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China...on the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak,\" he said.\n",
      "On Thursday, France confirmed that a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus later became infected himself. The doctor is now being treated in an isolated room at a Paris hospital. Outbreak specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission.\n",
      "A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.\n",
      "China raised the death toll to 170 on Thursday and more countries reported infections, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from China's worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation.\n",
      "Russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak. It had been de facto closed because of the Lunar New Year holiday, but Russian authorities said the closure would be extended until March 1.\n",
      "Train traffic between the countries was halted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air traffic between the two countries continued, at least for now. Russia has not confirmed any cases of the virus.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases virus. The man in the U.S. is married to a 60-year-old Chicago a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak.\n",
      "There have been cases reported of the infectious virus spreading to others in a household or workplace in China and elsewhere. The case in South Korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier.\n",
      "The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, a cousin of the new virus.\n",
      "The latest figures for mainland China show an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,736 confirmed cases. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, and one was in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Outside China, there are 82 infections in 18 countries, according to WHO.\n",
      "China extended its Lunar New Year holiday to Sunday to try to keep people home, but the wave of returning travelers could potentially cause the virus to spread further.\n",
      "Transport ministry spokesman Wu Chungeng outlined a series of rigorous temperature checks and other \"severe measures\" to detect possibly infectious passengers. Transport restrictions such as those isolating Wuhan and suspending inter-provincial bus services would remain in place, Wu said.\n",
      "\"It's definitely very challenging, but we're confident we can exert effective control,\" Wu told reporters at the briefing.\n",
      "To date, about 99% of the cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at 2%, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it’s likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed.\n",
      "In comparison, the SARS virus killed about 10% of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS.\n",
      "Chinese authorities have demanded anyone who traveled from or through Wuhan report to health authorities and self-quarantine themselves for 14 days, the maximum incubation period during which patients can be infectious even if they don't show symptoms.\n",
      "China has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumors — a reflection of the one-party Communist state's determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media.\n",
      "That stands in stark contrast to the initial response to SARS, when medical reports were hidden as state secrets. The delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide, killing around 800 people.\n",

      "And then there were five. After a blockbuster earnings report, Amazon is poised to reenter the growing club of $1 trillion public companies when US markets open on Friday — joining Apple ( AAPL ) , Microsoft ( MSFT ) , Saudi Aramco and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) at the top of the heap. Amazon's beat: Amazon ( AMZN ) blew away Wall Street's expectations when it reported earnings for the holiday quarter on Thursday, my CNN Business colleague Clare Duffy reports. The company posted profits of $3.3 billion. Analysts had expected $2 billion. Revenue, meanwhile, jumped 21%. Big number: A record 150 million people now subscribe to Amazon Prime. That's a positive sign for the company's expensive efforts to roll out one-day shipping in the United States. Shares are up 8.5% in premarket trading. If that holds, Amazon will jump back above a $1 trillion valuation, a level it first surpassed in 2018 . Read More The spike is a boon for CEO Jeff Bezos, who really needed a good week. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told me that he's impressed with Amazon's commitment to generating cash and adding \"more and more spokes\" to the wheel, a reference to the company's many revenue streams. \"Every time you look at a new set of Amazon numbers there seems to be something new to get excited about,\" he said, pointing to growth in Amazon's fledging efforts to sell directly to businesses. But the stock gain could trigger further conversations about consolidation in the stock market, considering a handful of tech companies now account for roughly a fifth of the S&P 500. See here: If Amazon shares open up as much as expected, the company could soon approach the same value as Germany's entire benchmark stock index ($1.15 trillion). Hyett points out that these companies aren't as monolithic as they may seem at first blush. Amazon has the characteristics of a retailer, Google dominates in marketing and Microsoft makes software — all distinct parts of the tech universe, he notes. Still, it means the US stock market is heavily exposed to a specific type of company: one with a marquee credit rating that is focused on high growth. \"Should we have a shift in the ratings environment, that's going to really hurt the whole market, just because of the percentage they contribute,\" Hyett said. Ginni Rometty, a favorite of Corporate America, is retiring It's the end of an era at IBM ( IBM ) . CEO Ginni Rometty, who has led the tech giant since 2012, is stepping down in April, the company announced Thursday. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty to retire in April Details, details: Rometty will be succeeded by Arvind Krishna, who is currently senior vice president for cloud and cognitive software. Jim Whitehurst, the Red Hat CEO who many thought would take Rometty's job, will become IBM's president. Rometty will remain IBM until her retirement at the end of the year. Shares of IBM are up nearly 4% in premarket trading on the news. No surprise: Rometty, who is 62, was expected to retire soon, since previous IBM chiefs had stepped down around the age of 60, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica reports. Krishna is 57 and Whitehurst is 52. But her departure means that the ranks of women who run large companies will grow even smaller. There were only 33 women CEOs in charge of Fortune 500 firms as of last year, including Rometty. \"Even though IBM's stock performance was more volatile than desired by Wall Street, she left a lasting mark on one of the cornerstone American companies,\" said Tim Hubbard, a professor at Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business and a former IBM consultant. He called Rometty \"one of the most prestigious female CEOs of the past decade.\" Investor insight: IBM shares have dropped 26% since Rometty took the helm, even as the broader stock market shot up. Still, she's been applauded for pushing IBM into the lucrative world of cloud computing, particularly through the company's $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat in 2018. The coronavirus outbreak is now an international emergency Markets in Europe are falling Friday as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread globally — leading the World Health Organization to declare a public health emergency of international concern. The latest: At least 213 people are dead and more than 9,700 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in mainland China. There are now more than 150 confirmed cases of the virus outside mainland China, including six in the United States and two in the United Kingdom. Investors initially took some comfort in the WHO declaration, since it could help mobilize resources to keep the virus contained. But the situation is clearly volatile.

      "Seated in a walled park in Hong Kong, (from left) Amy Taylor, Qu Xuejing (or “Zoe”), Alan Taylor and Zoe’s husband, Wang Wei, pose for a photo during a visit by the Taylors that was abruptly cut short because of the Chinese government’s shutting down of tourist destinations in hopes of curbing the transmission of a deadly new form of coronavirus that has spread from central China to a growing swath of the world. (Photo: Furnished) The deadly coronavirus that has spread from China to a dozen or more countries, including the United States, hasn’t sickened anyone in Kentucky yet, so far as is known. But it effectively chased a Henderson couple halfway across the world. Alan and Amy Taylor departed for Hong Kong on Jan. 21 to visit a young Chinese woman they hosted in their home and befriended when she was a graduate student, and to meet her new husband. They also scheduled a guided tour of mainland China that would take them to Beijing and a variety of popular tourist destinations. But just a day and a half after arriving, the Taylors got a call from their travel agency to advise them that the Great Wall and other tourist spots they hoped to visit had been closed to limit the spread of the mysterious new virus, which causes a respiratory illness that can be fatal. They could get a refund on their tour, but they had to decide right then. With their touring plans scuttled, they quickly decided to request the refund and scramble to secure two tickets on airplanes that were rapidly filling up as foreigners fled China. What’s remarkable is, this wasn’t the worst part of what Alan Taylor would call “the trip from hell.” Let’s start at the beginning. In 2017, the Taylors agreed to host for three weeks a 24-year-old Chinese woman, Qu Xuejing, who was studying to become a schoolteacher and was traveling to Henderson to shadow a local teacher at work. She had selected the English name Zoe. “We fell in love with her,” Amy said. “She called us grandmama and grandpapa … She’s got a magnetic personality.” The affection was mutual; with financial help from the Taylors and friends, Zoe returned that summer for a fun visit. A third visit would follow. Amy Taylor cherishes letters and inscriptions in greeting cards in which Zoe — who is fluent in speaking and writing in English — expresses her affection and love for the Taylors and experiences and food they shared with her, from driving a tractor and letting her climb into a deer stand to trying barbecue (which she loved) and sweet corn (which she found far too sweet to her taste). Fast forward to 2020. Zoe was newly married and the Taylors were preparing to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. A big trip to visit Zoe and her husband, Wang Wei, for a few days and then to tour mainland China seemed ideal to the Taylors, who have traveled multiple times to Europe and elsewhere. On the afternoon of Jan. 21, the Taylors and 187 other passengers and crew members were flying in an Airbus A350-900 jetliner high above the Arctic Ocean en route to Seoul, South Korea. It was to be one of many stops on their two-week journey. Then something happened.\n",
      "Alan and Amy Taylor’s shortened excursion to China ended with a cramped 15-hour flight back to the U.S. wearing masks as a precaution against being infected by a new coronavirus that had swept across China and conceivably could have been borne by someone on the plane. (Photo: Photo furnished) “I know when we were cruising at 40,000 feet and he (the pilot) made a sharp turn, you don’t do that,” Alan Taylor said. “It kind of made the hair stand up on the back of my neck,” Amy said. Over the intercom, the pilot informed the passengers of “a little mechanical problem with one of the engines,” Alan said. At 2:15 p.m. local time, the pilots advised the tower at Fairbanks (Alaska) International Airport that they were diverting their flight and would be landing there, according to a subsequent account in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner newspaper. It gave the Taylors an opportunity to see the remoteness of the country they were flying over, deep in the interior of Alaska. “There were hundreds of miles of nothing — just snow and mountains and trees,” Alan said. Fairbanks itself has a population not much bigger than Henderson. Delta Flight 159 made its unscheduled landing at 3:46 p.m. When the plane stopped, its passengers found themselves surrounded by fire trucks and other safety and emergency apparatus. Clearly, their situation had been potentially perilous. Subsequently, passengers were informed that one of the airplane’s two engines had failed in-flight “and the pilot had never flown with one engine before,” according to Alan. “He did a good job for a guy who had never done it before,” he said. But the Taylors and the rest now found themselves in Fairbanks in the dead of winter. The temperature when they arrived was 19 degrees below zero. “It was the off-season there,” Amy said. What few daily flights depart Fairbanks in January were mostly regional jaunts to destinations such as Anaktuvuk, Manley Hot Springs and Prudhoe Bay/Deadhorse.\n",
      "Amy and Alan Taylor pose for a photo while on a scenic cruiise on Hong Kong’s harbor. When not posing for pictures, the Taylors and their Chinese friends routinely wore masks to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus. (Photo: Furnished) “There was nobody there (at the airport),” she said. Extra help had to be summoned to issue replacement tickets and hotel vouchers for their unplanned overnight stay. It took hours. The Taylors said passengers were informed that there was no secure place to store their luggage overnight; they would need to haul their suitcases to the hotel. “Four hours later, we got our bags,” Alan said. There were further delays in getting shuttles to a hotel. “I said it can’t get any worse,” Amy said. “And it did,” her husband said. Initially, passengers were told they would need to be back at the airport at 4 a.m., then 6 a.m. Ultimately, the Taylors said, a new plane that had been flown in from Detroit and had to be refueled didn’t leave the gate until 11:30 a.m. But eventually, their journey resumed. Zoe and her husband traveled by train about an hour to meet the Taylors in Hong Kong. She was off work because of the extended Chinese New Year holiday and her school’s winter break. The plan had been for a festive visit. But already, the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak — and fears that it could be as fatal as its earlier viral cousins SARS and MERS — was becoming evident. “They showed up with masks on, and they brought masks for us,” Amy said. “Everyone had masks.” But with their young hosts, the Taylors enjoyed the beginning of their visit. “We ate foods I’d never seen before,” Alan said. “The vegetables were weird, but good. We ate fried fish skin. It was good” — sort of like pork rinds, his wife said. They ate duck and excellent sushi, and enjoyed the glitter of the Hong Kong skyscraper skyline and a harbor cruise. But even in semi-autonomous Hong Kong — a British crown colony from 1843 until 1997 — the Taylors were startled by the weight of authoritarian rule and surveillance. “There were tons of uniformed people,” Amy said — so many that it made Alan feel as if they were in a militarized zone. “They took our fingerprints and thumbprints,” she said. “And there were cameras everywhere,” which they knew were coupled with facial recognition software. Meanwhile, public health concerns over the coronavirus were closing in on the American tourists. Before they traveled, they were “vaguely” aware of the issue, Alan said. “We thought, just be smart” about hygiene, he said. “Once we got there, it just blew up.” “After two days, the government shut down all the public attraction sites; they didn’t exist,” Amy said. “They closed all schools for a month.” And the buildup to Chinese New Year on Jan. 25, which normally is accompanied by days of endless fireworks explosions, was uncharacteristically silent. “There was not one firework,” she said. “Everything was shut down.” Then came the phone call reporting that they had to decide immediately to request a refund on their guided tour since the places they intended to visit on their guided tour were shut down indefinitely.\n",
      "A roasted goose hangs in a market in Hong Kong during Alan and Amy Taylor’s short visit. (Photo: Photo furnished) The Taylors pulled the plug. They learned that they could fly to Shanghai to catch a flight back to America. But before the hotel there would let them check in overnight, they had to have their temperatures taken with a digital device applied to the palms of their hands. The Taylors were assigned a window seat and middle seat on the back row of the plane, where a rear bulkhead didn’t allow them to lean back their seats. But the people in the row ahead could lower their seats into the Taylor’s laps. So it went for a 15-hour flight. “I could hardly move,” Amy said. “It was the most uncomfortable I’ve been for so long in my life.” “I think that was the worst part of the whole trip,” Alan said. “I think I was about at wit’s end,” Amy said. They got back to their Deepwood Drive home at about sundown last Sunday. For all their ambitious plans, “We spent more hours in the air than on the ground,” Amy said. “It was pretty neat,” she said of their time in Hong Kong, which they found delightful. “But that was a lot of traveling for two days” of touring. As short at their time in China was, it won’t soon be forgotten. “It’s one for the books,” Amy Taylor said.

      "Tweet: Stephen Robinson January 30, 2020 10:22 AM The SARS-like coronavirus has spread rapidly in China. The death toll is now at 170 people, and almost 8,000 people are infected, including 7,711 on the Chinese mainland. It's very unfortunate -- unless you're an absolute ghoul like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, in which case this is all great news for the US economy. The commerce secretary was on Fox Business this morning, boasting to host Maria Bartiromo that it was \"physically impossible\" for the US to experience a recession this year. The American economy has no corporeal form, so this seems a safe bet. The topic turned to the coronavirus, and Bartiromo mentioned how \"you could see the Chinese economy come to a halt.\" Did that threaten Ross's cheerful outlook on the global economy? Not at all, the old Grinchy Claus hissed. The coronavirus will deliver economic gifts for America we don't want to miss! ROSS: First of all, every American's heart has to go out to the victims of the coronavirus, so I don't want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease. But the fact is this does give businesses ... Then he coughed, like a sick person. The timing was glorious. He recovered quickly and continued. ROSS: ... yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain. On top of all the other things, you have SARS, you have the African swine virus there, now you have this ... It's always something! Yeah, Ross is implying China is a disaster movie set, and any serious business with a zero-tolerance cooties policy will want to stay far way. ROSS: It's another risk factor that people need to take into account. So I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. This is both grotesque and stupid. Donald Trump thought his dumb trade war would drive US companies out of China and back into America's waiting arms. It didn't work. We also don't have the workers. Ross can fearmonger all he wants but it won't convince businesses to abandon China. Besides, gun violence kills about 100 Americans daily. At least China doesn't think the answer to the coronavirus is more \"good guys with the coronavirus.\" We also have purely preventable measles outbreaks. No one's part in the supply chain is perfect. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro confirmed Wednesday that Trump has no intention of removing tariffs on Chinese imports, despite the coronavirus's impact on China's economy. Navarro said we should remember why the tariffs exist in the first place, and he repeated Trump's anti-China talking points. NAVARRO: The tariffs are in place because China engages in massive unfair subsidies. They use their state-owned enterprises to put American companies and workers out of business. Yes indeed, the 1950s post-war labor market is returning to the US and we only have a potential international public health emergency to thank! [ New York Times ] Follow Stephen Robinson on Twitter.

      "Tweet: Wars and viruses: Are robots less prone to panic? By Saikat Chatterjee Pedestrians wearing facial masks are reflected on an electric board showing stock prices outside a brokerage at a business district in Tokyo More By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON (Reuters) - Widely blamed for volatile \"flash crashes\" in currencies and equities, high-frequency algorithms may also be why shock global events, including the current coronavirus, seem to have lost their power to spook markets for any length of time. Whether stocks, bonds, currencies or commodities, asset prices seem less prone to any selloff for very long; the U.S. killing of an Iranian general and Iran's retaliatory missile attack are among potential catastrophes that triggered violent but surprisingly shortlived reactions just since the start of 2020. In both cases, knee-jerk yen-buying and selling of equities faded within hours, allowing stocks to scale new record peaks. Now even as China's coronavirus threatens to throttle economic growth, global stocks are not far off all-time highs. Certainly, many factors are shaping the resilience, not least central bank money printing and rising global savings which boosted the value of world stocks by $25 trillion in the past decade. Yet it is hard not to link the shift in reaction by financial markets to the rise of automated trading strategies. In the past six years, the share of algo-trading in the $6.6 trillion-a-day FX market has more than doubled to 27% among fund managers, a survey by Greenwich Associates found. There is some reason to believe algos cause volatility, especially when trading thins and the humans overseeing them vanish, for instance during public holidays. That's what likely happened during the Wall Street flash crash of 2010 and dramatic but fleeting yen moves in Jan 2019. But they also offer the advantage of being able to transact at lightening speed at any hour of the day or night, with razor-sharp accuracy and lower overall costs. Being machines, they are also alien to the common human impulses of fear and greed that tend to take over. \"Human trading tends to be emotional but machine trading is very dispassionate,\" said Scott Wacker, global head of fixed income, currency and commodity e-sales at JPMorgan, one bank at the forefront of the algo revolution. \"As a result, the reaction functions in currency markets to even major geopolitical news has considerably shortened.\" In short, when left-field events hit, not only can algos scan and react swiftly to newsfeed, many now can gauge the potential asset price impact. The most sophisticated can be \"trained\" to learn from the experience before the next shock. One currency trader familiar with algo use said a machine reading coronavirus cases would typically buy stocks if informed of \"500 new cases, 10 deaths\". \"If it's '3000 new cases, 200 deaths' they might sell. \"The point being that as soon as a headline is out, the machine-led market is trading on it,\" the trader said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the machines had 'vol triggers', he said, meaning they can stop trading when the market moves beyond specified limits. HOW IT WORKS Simple first- and second-generation programmes merely broke down large buy/sell orders into chunks to minimise market impact. Now algos can be hooked up to sophisticated language processing technology, to \"read and analyse\" news feeds, then react accordingly, all in the space of seconds, said Antony Foster, head of G10 FX trading at Nomura. However this can \"lead to overreaction in the first instance\", Foster warned. The impact in fast-moving markets can be outsized if the models rapidly push prices towards existing buy/sell order levels, trip them and trigger other orders. That's what happened when news broke of Iran's Jan. 8 attack, according to a quant fund manager, who said algos had bought yen with the aim of triggering larger buy orders once a key option barrier was tripped. A plausible comparison may be the 0.6% plunge in the S&P 500 within the space of half an hour on Jan. 29. The move came after American Airlines and Lufthansa said they were suspending their China flights, but an hour later, the losses had been recouped. Stephane Malrait, ING Bank's head of market structure and innovation, says in such instances algos are programmed to check if moves are in line with price trends. If the swings are in response to the an incident, human traders can step in to smooth out the trade, Malrait added. Next, the algos may gauge the seriousness of the incident based on patterns of investor behaviour and economic consequences that followed previous such episodes. After the Iran missile attacks, the message from the specialised data-crunchers to the algos was: stand down. One was Geoquant, a U.S. firm which monitors geopolitical events and models the asset price impact. \"We modelled our Iranian geopolitical indicator back to seven years... and put the current tensions against that backdrop,\" said Geoquant CEO Mark Rosenberg, who concluded the risk would subside, with minimal oil price impact. Another firm, Predata, applied its machine-reading algorithm to last September's attacks on Saudi oil facilities, which had raised fears of a regional war. To predict what might happen next, the programme compares interested parties' online attention to a subject, with the media coverage it receives, Predata CEO Hazem Dawani said. The Saudi event elicited little reaction from military officials and policymakers. \"The amount of news was far more than the amount of attention being devoted on the particular subject by investors, politicians, companies directly impacted by them,\" Dawani said. He concluded - rightly - that there would be no escalation. VIRUS UNKNOWNS Executives at half a dozen firms providing risk analysis for algo strategies told Reuters their services were increasingly in demand, but declined to give figures. But they acknowledged limitations. Reactions to the coronavirus for instance could be hobbled because the only meaningful precedent is the 2003 SARS epidemic which also coincided with the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Second, the pathogen and its dangers are relatively unknown. Rosenberg said Geoquant's China Health Risk index was at record highs. That has pushed up the firm's Social Instability Risk index for China, pressuring Chinese markets. However, he said this correlation breaks down beyond short periods. \"The longer-term relationship between Chinese Health Risk and equities, Chinese or global, is basically zero,\" he said.

      "The new coronavirus, 2019 n-CoV, continues to spread in China, and cases are being diagnosed in many other countries, including the U.S. In some of those countries , including Germany and Vietnam, people who have not visited China have been diagnosed . The initial symptoms of coronavirus resemble other diseases, so many people are wondering how to know whether to seek medical help. 1. With the new coronavirus now in the U.S., am I at risk?\n",
      "The biggest risk factors for being infected with the new coronavirus are travel to China, particularly Wuhan and other areas of Hubei Province, and close contact with a person who has a suspected or confirmed n-CoV case. Without those risk factors, the chance for the general American public of catching this virus is low.\n",
      "However, the outbreak is rapidly changing, and it is unclear how the situation in the U.S. will evolve in upcoming weeks. 2. What are the symptoms of 2019 n-CoV?\n",
      "Most cases of 2019 n-CoV have had fever and signs of pneumonia, like cough or shortness of breath. In some cases people are not able to breathe on their own and require the use of a ventilator. A small percentage of people die. 3. What should I do if I have any of these symptoms?\n",
      "If you experience any of these symptoms within 14 days of travel to China, or within 14 days of coming in close contact with an individual infected with the coronavirus, you should immediately call your health care provider. It is best to call ahead before going to a clinic or emergency room. See also When will there be a coronavirus vaccine? 5 questions answered\n",
      "Your health care provider will evaluate you with the help of your state’s public health department and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . If your travel history and reported symptoms fit with n-CoV infection, you may be tested for the virus. Right now that test can be performed only at the CDC, so your health care provider would send samples to the CDC for testing. 4. What else could it be?\n",
      "At this time of year many respiratory viruses are circulating in the community, including influenza, RSV , rhinovirus and human coronaviruses, which are different from the 2019 n-CoV virus. It is much more likely that you have one of these viruses than the 2019 n-CoV virus, even if you have traveled to China. 5. So there are other coronaviruses?\n",
      "Yes. There are four human coronaviruses that circulate each year in the U.S. They cause 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract illnesses in the U.S., with mild symptoms akin to the common cold. Health care labs can test for these coronaviruses — but not for 2019 n-CoV.\n",

      "GENEVA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that the novel coronavirus outbreak has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n",
      "Speaking at a press conference after a closed-door meeting of the Emergency Committee, he stressed that the WHO disfavors or even opposes imposing travel or trade restrictions on China.\n",
      "Under the International Health Regulations (IHR), the WHO director-general has the authority to determine that an outbreak constitutes a PHEIC when certain conditions are met. The designation is aimed at mobilizing more international resources to deal with the epidemic.\n",
      "Since the IHR entered into force in 2007, the WHO has made multiple PHEIC declarations.\n",
      "Ghebreyesus noted that Chinese President Xi Jinping personally commands and deploys the prevention and containment efforts.\n",
      "\"The speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO and the world are very impressive, and beyond words. So is China's commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries,\" he said.\n",
      "\"In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response,\" he added.\n",
      "That reflects not only China's high sense of responsibility for the lives and health of its own people, but also its strong support for global disease prevention and control, he said.\n",
      "Ghebreyesus said he believes that China will effectively contain and eventually defeat the epidemic, adding that China's efforts to combat the disease deserve respect and appreciation, and are worth learning.\n",
      "In fact, many of the prevention and containment measures China has taken far exceed relevant requirements for dealing with emergencies, and the measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world.\n",
      "Now the situation is still developing and more research is needed, and particularly countries with fragile health systems should enhance their responses, said the WHO chief.\n",
      "That is the main reason behind the PHEIC declaration, he said, adding that considering global health security, it is also a necessary step to achieve a scientific, rational and calm response based on evidence, and to help other countries take scientific, reasonable and appropriate measures to prevent the epidemic.\n",

      "The trailing year has been challenging for Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) and that’s reflected in the company’s stock price. Ford stock trades at almost the same level as it was in January 2019. While there are positives to talk about, I believe that headwinds are likely to dominate headlines in 2020. I therefore remain neutral on Ford stock but would consider gradual exposure if the stock trades around $8. Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n",
      "The vehicle sales outlook for 2020 is the first reason to believe that the year will be challenging for Ford. According to AGL, the analytics subsidiary of TrueCar (NASDAQ: TRUE ), light vehicle sales for 2020 will likely come in around 16.9 million units. This implies a decline of 0.8% as compared to 2019.\n",
      "For China, vehicle sales are projected to decline by 2% for 2020 to 25.3 million units . The impact of coronavirus on GDP growth and consumer confidence is still to be discounted in these numbers. Even on a consolidated global basis, vehicle sales are expected to decline for the third consecutive year . Therefore, conditions will remain challenging for the industry and Ford will feel the impact. A Crucial Year in China\n",
      "For 2019, Ford reported a decline in sales of 26.1% as compared to 2018 . As a broad market trend, Japanese and German brands have “weathered the slowdown better than local and American ones.”\n",
      "As challenging conditions sustain, 2020 to 2023 are the most crucial years for Ford in China. In particular, the year 2020 will dictate the likely trend.\n",
      "To elaborate, Ford will be launching 30 new models in China over the next three years . This is possibly the last attempt to revive sales and gain market share. It is also important to mention that one third of the models will be electric cars. Compare Brokers\n",
      "There is no doubt that China’s electric vehicle market has potential in the long-term. But the market is already over-crowded and Ford’s strategy remains to be seen. Additionally, new energy vehicle sales declined by 4% in 2019 due to subsidy cuts .\n",
      "With a weak macro-economic environment and high level of competition, Ford has a big challenge ahead. Ford is bullish on China for 2020 and 2021 in terms of cutting losses . However, if China’s sales fail to revive in 2020, Ford stock can potentially trend lower. Trucks Will Continue to Drive Cash Flows\n",
      "Even amidst challenges and losses in China, Ford reported operating cash flow of $14.7 billion for the first nine months of 2019.\n",
      "The key cash flow driver for Ford is the company’s robust truck sales in the U.S. For fourth-quarter 2019, Ford reported 15.9% growth in truck sales on a year-on-year basis. Sales growth was driven by the F-Series coupled with the Ranger.\n",
      "Back in 2018, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimated that F-Series sales were responsible for 90% of Ford’s global profits . The scenario is no different in 2020. Truck sales have provided the company with cash flow cover as it continues to invest in China.\n",
      "Even for 2020, I believe that F-Series sales will remain strong as the trend is sharply shifting in favor of pick-ups in the U.S. Car sales for Ford slumped by 41% in Q4 2019, with truck sales surging by 15.9% for the same period. My Final Views on Ford Stock\n",
      "Ford stock remaining sideways in the trailing year is an indication of the markets being in a “wait and watch” mode. Truck sales in the U.S. will continue to impress, coupled with commercial vehicle sales in Europe.\n",
      "However, Ford’s plans for China and its impact on growth will trigger stock movement. I am afraid that it’s likely to be a difficult year considering the broad industry outlook. Therefore, it makes sense to stay on the sidelines.\n",
      "If China’s growth plans do work, there will be opportunities in the coming quarters to consider exposure to Ford stock.\n",

      "My mind seems to be filled up with so many random thoughts with none of them particularly related to each other.

      "The shocking news of Kobe Bryant’s death with his daughter and seven others brought to light that we, as a society, still have a problem dealing with what’s been swept under the rug. Discussion of the sexual assault he was accused of back in 2003 started almost as soon as news of his death was made public. Even with the changes in our sensibilities in those intervening years, it’s clear we have a long way to go in dealing honestly and fairly with celebrities who offer, shall we say, a mixed legacy.\n",
      "Ken Starr showed up front and center at the impeachment trial this week in defense of Trump. Ken Starr? Really? The same guy who defended Jeffrey Epstein against charges of statutory rape in 2007? The one who worked on that sweetheart deal for 13 months on work release with a stay in the private wing of the Palm Beach jail? Sure, even Epstein deserved legal defense, but Starr’s support of Christopher Kloman, a retired teacher and friend of the family, after his admission of molesting five female students is a bit beyond the pale. (Starr asked the court for leniency; Kloman got 43 years in prison.)\n",
      "The icing on the cake came at Baylor University, when Starr as president and chancellor mishandled several sexual assault cases and was removed as president followed by his resignation as chancellor a few days later. But we all know Starr’s real claim to fame was his role as independent counsel during the Clinton administration. His defense of Trump included publicly contradicting himself from 20 years ago and bemoaning that we live in “the age of impeachment.” He wailed, “How did we get here?” Well, you may have been driving, Mr. Starr.\n",
      "While one can use a broom to sweep Bryant’s and Starr’s past under the rug, it requires a bulldozer for John Bolton. To enumerate everything he has said and done over the course of his career that have made him anathema to Democrats would try our collective patience. So we’ll just stick with his super-hawkishness. He has advocated for regime change in Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Venezuela, and Yemen, and he doesn’t mean “Wouldn’t it nice if the people overthrew the government?” regime change. When Trump tweeted, “If I listened to him, we would be in World War Six by now,” that’s probably true. Of course, even that contradicts what Trump had previously said about Bolton, but consistency is not one of Trump’s virtues.\n",
      "Now that Bolton seems willing to provide testimony in the impeachment trial that could prove damaging to Trump, the old warmonger has found his way under the bus that keeps rolling over everyone who has, or even may, break ranks with the White House. But that’s okay.\n",
      "Some Democrats seem eager to put their eggs in the Bolton basket (oh, that basket again). Even Adam “I’m no fan of John Bolton, but I like him a little more now than I used to” Schiff seems to be willing to—if not crawl into bed with—at least transact a little business with him. Oh, Adam, maybe you’re doing the right thing. But, to reframe and paraphrase something Bolton himself once said, you want a butterfly. Do you intend to put lipstick on a caterpillar and call it a success?\n",

      "The online row is the latest flashpoint in a long-standing debate around Taiwan — the self-ruled island considered by China to be one of its wayward provinces — one which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has freshly waded into.\n",
      "This week, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which is based in Montreal, blocked numerous critics on Twitter who were voicing calls for Taiwan and Taiwanese experts to be included in discussions around the outbreak of a new coronavirus.\n",
      "In one case, a consultant was surprised to find he was blocked after only retweeting another user’s post calling for Taiwan’s participation.\n",

      "As the host country for the agency, they say Canada has a special stake in the issue and they applauded Trudeau’s response.\n",
      "“We understand the nuance behind how the UN can and cannot engage with Taiwan … (but) in light of the coronavirus, channels should be explored to allow information-sharing with Taiwan authorities to ensure that the virus can be contained,” said Jessica Drun, a Washington, D.C.-based Taiwan-China expert at the Project2049 think tank.\n",
      "In her tweet to the ICAO, Drun had noted that Taoyuan International Airport in Taipei is a major transportation hub and that there are frequent flights between Taiwan and mainland China.\n",
      "Taiwan also has a number of medical professionals who can make contributions, she said, before the ICAO account blocked her.\n",
      "ICAO is bound by a UN General Assembly resolution recognizing the People's Republic of China based in Beijing as the lawful government of China, but Taiwan under the name \"Chinese Taipei\" has been an invited guest to an ICAO Assembly in 2013 following approval from Beijing, Drun noted.\n",
      "YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN... Most criticisms have centred around whether it makes sense for Taiwan — as a major air-travel hub in Asia — not to have direct access to the agency to contribute in the fight against the coronavirus, which emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.\n",

Read More THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and health minister KK Shailaja urged Keralites not to panic after the first coronavirus case (nCoV) was reported in Thrissur on Thursday. The government also asked residents, who returned recently from China, to compulsorily adopt home quarantine and approach the nearest hospital if they have fever, cough or sore throat.\n",
      "“We have initiated a series of measures to tackle the emergency; contact tracing, case isolation, quality care and community engagement are being done diligently. Care must be taken so that rumours do not spread on social media. We are closely monitoring the situation. We need to be cautious, but there is no need to panic. Our health network is capable of handling emergencies,” said Vijayan.\n",
      "Shailaja said those who returned from countries where nCoV cases were confirmed should skip public gatherings. “Though we tracked down most people who came from regions with nCoV cases through airports, there are others who did not report before health department. They should immediately visit the nearest health centre. Most students and others, who came from China, reported to the nearest health centres,” she said.\n",
      "The health machinery is well equipped to prevent the spread of the virus and the department needs the support of the people who returned from these regions. People should realize that self-quarantine is the key to control the spread of the virus, the minister said.\n",
      "“Community spread is the major fear factor. The virus has spread in China’s community. The virus transmission was from human to human. Hence, we must prevent the spread of virus in the community,” said Indu PS, who heads the department of community medicine at Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital.\n",
      "Virus, from the student who tested positive, should be contained. Already three people who were closely associated with the student have been isolated and admitted at the general hospital. Their blood and swab samples have been sent for testing, she said.\n",
      "Dr Indu said that people who were closely associated with the student in college and family members will also have to be screened now. “ The threat is less since the student was isolated when she developed sore throat. Hence, chance of the virus spreading among people is less,’’ she said.\n",
      "The minister said that control rooms have been set up in all districts and people who have any kind of symptoms like fever, cough or sore throat should immediately contact the control rooms.\n",

      "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejected calls from a medical union on Friday to close the border with mainland China to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, and urged health staff not to go through with a threatened strike.\n",
      "The recently formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said earlier on Friday 6,500 of its members would go on strike if the frontier stayed open, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global emergency.\n",
      "The WHO recommended all countries try to prevent or reduce cross-border spread of disease, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. But it said measures should avoid unnecessary interference with trade or travel.\n",
      "\"I am afraid (closing the border) contradicts the WHO suggestion ... which asks governments not to take any measures that may fuel discrimination,\" Lam told a news conference.\n",
      "She announced a raft of new measures against the disease and said any industrial action by medical staff would only make the situation worse.\n",

      "Lam said that on Jan. 30, only 9.7% of arrivals into Hong Kong, excluding those at the airport, were from mainland China, and most of the rest were returning Hong Kong citizens. She said she expected the flow to shrink as many mainland cities were under lockdown.\n",
      "About 37,000 Hong Kongers crossed the mainland border the other way into China that day, she said.\n",
      "NEW MEASURES\n",
      "The health scare comes after months of often violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong triggered by fears its high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, is being eroded by Beijing. The central government denies meddling.\n",
      "Protesters frustrated by the government's refusal to make concessions on demands for full democracy have in recent months formed about 40 unions to keep up the pressure on the authorities.\n",
      "In a news conference earlier on Friday, Winnie Yu, the chairwoman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, said its members may go a strike next week unless the border was closed. Other new unions have pledged support.\n",
      "Lam had previously ordered the suspension of the high-speed rail service between the city and mainland China and all cross-border ferry services, but the unions said it was not enough.\n",
      "The new measures announced on Friday included checks on people's temperatures as they left Hong Kong.\n",

      "Tweet: The first cases of the coronavirus have been diagnosed in the UK, with two people from the same family being treated at a specialist centre.\" data-reactid=\"18\">The first cases of the coronavirus have been diagnosed in the UK, with two people from the same family being treated at a specialist centre. The announcement was made as more than 80 Britons on an evacuation flight from the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak landed back in the UK. The two patients are currently being treated by Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in its specialist Airborne High Consequences Infectious Disease Centre (HCID). It is understood that they travelled to the UK from China in recent days, had been staying at a hotel in Yorkshire, and are now undergoing treatment at the Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary. 【ギャラリー】Coronavirus crisis40 An outbreak investigation team has been formed to trace anyone who has been in contact with the pair to prevent onward transmission. Professor Sharon Peacock from Public Health England said anyone who has been in contact with the two patients in England should self-isolate for 14 days, and if they develop any symptoms they are advised to call 111 or their GP. She said while staff are currently working to trace people who have been in contact with the pair, they do not currently have \"any idea\" of how high that number might be. In a statement, chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said: \"The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus. \"The NHS is extremely well prepared and used to managing infections, and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread. \"We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. \"We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organisation and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities.\" (PA Graphics) More Anyone who comes to the UK from anywhere in China and shows any symptoms associated with the coronavirus should \"self-isolate\" for 14 days, Prof Whitty added. It comes as ministers said the Government will send another plane to coronavirus-hit Wuhan to rescue British citizens if needed. Families had been told that relatives with Chinese passports would be unable to join them after Chinese officials denied them permission to leave the country. That decision was reversed hours before the plane was due to depart, but some people did not have time to get to the airport. The PA news agency understands that the Foreign Office (FCO) is working with EU countries to add British passengers to any rescue flights they may charter back from Wuhan. After several delays, the evacuation flight left Wuhan at 9.45am local time on Friday, carrying 83 Britons and 27 non-UK nationals, mostly from EU countries. The flight arrived at the Brize Norton RAF base in Oxfordshire at around 1.30pm. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told Sky News on Friday that another plane will be sent if necessary. He added: \"The flight which is in the air at the moment is not the end of our efforts. \"It is only one part that we are doing in order to keep people safe.\" The evacuation flight came after the UK's four chief medical officers raised the risk level of the illness from low to moderate and the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared an international public health emergency. Story continues Chinese health officials said on Friday morning that the death toll in the country from the virus had risen to 213, with the number of known cases rising from 7,711 to 9,962. No deaths have occurred outside China, although cases have been confirmed across at least 23 countries. (PA Graphics) More The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has now surpassed that of the Sars epidemic, although death rates are currently lower, suggesting it is less deadly. Many other countries, including Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand have said they plan to quarantine evacuees for two weeks to avoid spread of the virus. The British passengers on the UK evacuation flight – who have mainly been in Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province – had to sign a contract agreeing to isolation before they could board the flight. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said all passengers had undergone screening before boarding the plane and were subject to ongoing questioning and continuous risk assessment during the journey. The passengers are now being taken by bus to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral for a quarantine period of 14 days, where they will be housed in an NHS staff accommodation block with access to the internet. Passengers disembark at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire (Ben Birchall/PA) More They are being given fully-furnished rooms, food, laundry facilities and have access to a team of medical staff who will closely monitor their condition. Kitchens are available for those who wish to self-cater, and families are being kept together, with games consoles, toys and cots provided. Anyone with suspicious symptoms will be taken to the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospital. On Wednesday night, an apartment-hotel in Yorkshire was put on lockdown when a man, understood to be a Chinese national, was taken to hospital after falling ill. The man, who was a guest at the Staycity Hotel in the centre of York, was taken to hospital, together with family members. \n",

      "After a year away from family, she visited Wuhan for the Chinese New Year, a highly anticipated and celebrated occasion in Chinese culture to be with family. The coronavirus outbreak has left her stranded in the province, unable to return back to Australia to resume university.

      "“The Coronavirus is taking away the only time of the year that families get to reunite,” Chen continued in her post, “These selfish exotic traders have taken away precious family time from all these people who are literally putting their lives in danger to help others, and yet on the Internet, these unsung heroes are being lumped together with them, criticized, condemned, and humiliated. It’s really heartbreaking. Those people don’t deserve any of it.”\n",

      "Updated at 7:30 p.m. ET\n",
      "The World Health Organization announced Thursday that the outbreak of a deadly and fast-spreading strain of coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency.\n",
      "\"Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen, which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.\n",
      "However, Tedros was adamant that \"the main reason for the declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries. ... Let me be clear — this vote is not a declaration of no confidence in China.\" He said that the WHO is deeply concerned about what will happen if the virus begins spreading in countries with weak health systems and that the purpose of the declaration is to help those countries.\n",
      "The declaration of a global health emergency can work to galvanize international funding. According to the WHO's procedures , the three criteria for such a declaration are that it is an \"extraordinary event,\" that it \"constitute[s] a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease\" and that it \"potentially require[s] a coordinated international response.\"\n",
      "The last time the WHO announced an international health emergency was in July 2019 over the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Before that, international emergencies were declared in 2016 for the Zika virus and in 2014 for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n",
      "The new coronavirus has sickened around 9,800 people worldwide and killed at least 213 , all of them in China.\n",
      "The WHO said in a statement that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.\n",
      "\"There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. WHO doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement,\" Tedros added. But the WHO also said that in certain circumstances, such as when there are many cases of transmission among a vulnerable population, such measures could be \"temporarily useful.\"\n",
      "The coronavirus drew worldwide attention after Chinese authorities began reporting cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan last month. They were able to pinpoint the cause to a previously unknown strain. Other forms of coronavirus, such as SARS and MERS, have been responsible for past international outbreaks.\n",
      "Health authorities believe this particular strain, known as 2019-nCoV, likely first spread from an animal. China's National Health Commission has said it is associated with exposure at a seafood market in Wuhan that also sold live animals.\n",
      "Since then, the virus has spread from Wuhan to countries around the world, including the United States, Japan, Singapore and Thailand. \"The vast majority of those cases are still associated with travel to Wuhan,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program.\n",
      "\"We know that this virus can cause severe disease and that it can kill, although for most people it causes milder symptoms,\" Tedros told reporters last week. The WHO said that about 20% of those infected experience severe illness .\n",
      "Experts find the new coronavirus particularly concerning for several reasons. First, the WHO said there is evidence that the virus could spread from human to human. \"The disease is mainly a respiratory disease passing via droplets from one person to another and mostly still through close contact,\" Ryan said.\n",
      "The droplets could come from sneezing, coughing or even talking. This is worrying because it is easier for a virus to spread quickly between humans compared with a virus transmitted from an animal to humans. Human-to-human transmission has now been documented in three countries outside China, Tedros said.\n",
      "Second, experts still don't know for certain what animal the virus originated from in Wuhan. \"Until we know what the animal is, there potentially could still be animals being sold in markets all across China that is spilling virus over into people,\" Matthew Frieman, a virologist with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, recently told NPR's Nurith Aizenman .\n",
      "And third, Chinese authorities say the virus has also infected medical workers — people who already would be taking serious precautions to protect themselves.\n",
      "There is currently no targeted drug to treat the virus, Chinese health authorities said. And there is no vaccine to guard against it. Tedros is calling on countries to \"accelerate the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\"\n",
      "Several countries, including the U.S., have started to evacuate citizens from Wuhan because of concerns about the coronavirus. As NPR's Bill Chappell reported , American passengers broke into cheers after their flight from Wuhan touched down Tuesday night in Alaska. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising that travelers \"avoid all nonessential travel to all of [China].\"\n",
      "Major airlines, such as United Airlines and British Airways, have suspended flights to Chinese cities.\n",
      "Chinese health authorities recently announced new sweeping measures to try to contain the new coronavirus by implementing a strict quarantine on Wuhan, a city of some 11 million people. \"There's no sense of when the quarantine might be lifted,\" NPR's Emily Feng reported from Beijing. \"The big problem is that people are going to have to return to work soon, when the Lunar New Year is over. Many of them are coming from villages where there are very few screening measures for the virus.\"\n",
      "China's government has come under criticism for not responding more quickly to the outbreak. But WHO officials have praised the Chinese response.\n",
      "\"The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak, despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the Chinese people,\" Tedros said. \"In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response.\" Copyright 2020 NPR.

      "Tweet:  10:45 AM CST Jan 31, 2020 Scottie Andrew, CNN The novel coronavirus that's sickening thousands globally — and at least five people in the U.S. — is inspiring countries to close their borders and Americans to buy up surgical masks quicker than major retailers can restock them.There's another virus that has infected 15 million Americans across the country and killed more than 8,200 people this season alone. It's not a new pandemic: It's influenza.The 2019-2020 flu season is projected to be one of the worst in a decade, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At least 140,000 people have been hospitalized with complications from the flu, and that number is predicted to climb as flu activity swirls.The flu is a constant in Americans' lives. It's that familiarity that makes it more dangerous to underestimate, said Dr. Margot Savoy, chair of family and community medicine at Temple University's Lewis Katz School of Medicine.\"Lumping all the viral illness we tend to catch in the winter sometimes makes us too comfortable thinking everything is 'just a bad cold,'\" she said. \"We underestimate how deadly influenza really is.\"Even the low-end estimate of deaths each year is startling, Savoy said: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts at least 12,000 people will die of the flu in the U.S. every year. In the 2017-2018 flu season, as many as 61,000 people died and 45 million were sickened.In the 2019-2020 season so far, 15 million people in the U.S. have gotten the flu and 8,200 people have died of it, including at least 54 children. Flu activity has been elevated for 11 weeks straight, the CDC reported, and will likely continue for the next several weeks.Savoy, who also serves on the American Academy of Family Physician's board of directors, said the novelty of emerging infections can overshadow the flu. People are less panicked about the flu because healthcare providers \"appear to have control\" over the infection.\"We fear the unknown and we crave information about new and emerging infections,\" she said. \"We can't quickly tell what is truly a threat and what isn't, so we begin to panic — often when we don't need to.\"The flu can be fatalDr. Nathan Chomilo, an adjunct assistant professor of pediatrics at University of Minnesota Medical School, said that the commonness of the flu often underplays its severity, but people should take it seriously.\"Severe cases of the flu are not mild illnesses,\" Chomilo said. \"Getting the actual flu, you are miserable.\"The flu becomes dangerous when secondary infections emerge, the result of an already-weakened immune system. Bacterial and viral infections compound the flu's symptoms. People with chronic illnesses are also at a heightened risk for flu complications.Those complications include pneumonia, inflammation in the heart and brain and organ failure, which, in some cases, can be fatal.Chomilo, an internist and pediatrician for Park Nicollet Health Services, said this flu season has been one of the worst his Minnesota practice has seen since the H1N1 virus outbreak in 2009. Some of his patients, healthy adults in their 30s, have been sent to the intensive care unit, relying on ventilators, due to flu complications.The virus is always changingInfluenza is tricky because the virus changes every year. Sometimes, the dominant strain in a flu season will be more virulent than in previous years, which can impact the number of people infected and the severity of their symptoms.Most of these changes in the virus are small and insignificant, a process called antigenic drift. That year's flu vaccine is mostly effective in protecting patients in spite of these small changes, said Melissa Nolan, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina's School of Public Health.Occasionally, the flu undergoes a rare antigenic shift, which results when a completely new strain of virus emerges that human bodies haven't experienced before, she said.Savoy compares it to a block party: The body thinks it knows who — or in this case, which virus — will show up, and therefore, which virus it needs to keep out. But if a virus shows up in a completely new getup, it becomes difficult for the body's \"bouncers\" — that's the immune system — to know who to look for and keep out. The stealthy virus can infiltrate easily when the body doesn't recognize it.This flu season, there's no sign of antigenic shift, the most extreme change. But it's happened before, most recently in 2009 with the H1N1 virus. It became a pandemic because people had no immunity against it, the CDC reported.Get your flu shot, experts sayTo avoid complications from the flu, Savoy, Chomilo and Nolan have the same recommendation: Get vaccinated.It's not easy to tell how flu vaccination rates impact the number of people infected, but Savoy said it seems that the years she struggles to get her patients vaccinated are the years when more patients end up hospitalized with the flu, even if the total number of infections doesn't budge.The CDC reported at least 173 million flu vaccine doses have been administered this flu season so far. That's about 4 million more doses than the manufacturers who make the vaccines projected to provide this season.Still, there are some who decide skipping the vaccine is worth the risk. A 2017 study found that people decline the flu vaccine because they don't think it's effective or they're worried it's unsafe, even though CDC research shows the vaccine effectively reduces the risk of flu in up to 60% of the population.Chomilo said some of his most frustrating cases of the flu are in patients who can't be vaccinated because of preexisting conditions or their age (children under 6 months old can't be vaccinated).There are two important reasons to get the flu vaccine, he said, which are \"protecting yourself and being a good community member.\" CNN —\n",

      "The latest government advice came in the wake of widespread reports about panic buying of face masks and shortages.\n",

      "NBC NEWS – Facebook will start removing misinformation about the coronavirus outbreak from its platforms. In a blog post late Thursday, Facebook Head of Health Kang-Xing Jin said the firm would “remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them.” “This includes claims related to false cures or prevention methods — like drinking bleach cures the coronavirus — or claims that create confusion about health resources that are available,” Jin said. He added that Instagram would also ban or restrict hashtags and conduct “proactive sweeps” to remove content spreading misinformation about the virus. The move comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency over the fast-spreading virus, which has infected more than 9,809 people in China, killing 213. It’s not the first tech platform to start taking action over the outbreak however, with Google and Twitter also taking steps to tackle misinformation about it. Google for instance has started displaying information from the WHO about the virus in search results while its video-sharing platform YouTube is promoting videos on it from credible sources. Twitter meanwhile has adjusted its search prompt to lift information from “authoritative health sources” to the top of the page when users make searches about the coronavirus. Facebook has gotten into hot water over how it deals with health-related disinformation in the past. The social media giant was criticized for failing to remove anti-vaccination posts last year, instead opting to lower such content in the rankings of people’s feeds. It announced a partnership with the WHO in September aimed at steering users toward accurate vaccination information from the United Nations’ health agency. Facebook’s latest move on countering misinformation comes as the company faces intense regulatory scrutiny around the world, an issue that has weighed heavily on the company’s share price of late. The firm lost as much as $50 billion in market value this week after reporting a rise in expenses on the back of privacy and security updates. The company said Thursday that it would continue working with independent fact-checkers to limit the spread of false coronavirus claims and instead show accurate information on its platform. It will also run educational pop-ups with “credible information” and share data with researchers to help them forecast the spread of the virus. “Not all of these steps are fully in place. It will take some time to roll them out across our platforms and step up our enforcement methods,” said Jin. “We will provide updates on additional steps we are taking in coordination with global and regional partners as the situation continues to evolve.”\n",

The Fed, as expected, kept interest rates unchanged. Today, the pair will react to the Bank of England's announcement of its monetary policy at the last meeting of the Bank under the leadership of Mark Carney. Regarding leaving interest rates unchanged, the Fed said it viewed the current monetary policy stance as appropriate to support the continued growth of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and the return of inflation to the 2 percent target. The bank added that it will continue to monitor the implications of information provided on the economic outlook, including global developments and silent inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate course for prices. The consensus decision to leave interest rates unchanged was widely expected by economists, as Fed officials indicated that the central bank would remain on hold for the foreseeable future unless there was a fundamental shift in the economic outlook. CME's FedWatch tool currently indicates a 76.1 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting in March. In his press conference following the meeting, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that some uncertainties about trade had diminished after the signing of the US-China Phase 1 trade agreement. Powell noted that there are still some uncertainties about the global economic outlook, with the President of the Federal Reserve specifically referring to the outbreak of the new Corona virus. As for the Bank of England’s meeting today, no change in the bank's policy is widely expected, and the bank may keep rates as is at 0.75%. There will be careful monitoring of the contents of the monetary policy statement, economic forecasts and Carney's last statements as governor of the Bank of England. Advertisement TRADE NOW According to the technical analysis of the pair : On the daily chart, the GBP/USD pair confirmed the head and shoulders formation, and despite the technical indicators reaching oversold areas, stability below 1.3000 psychological support will continue to support the bear's control over the performance. Support levels at 1.2970 and 1.2890, respectively, may be the closest to the performance of the current pair. As we expected before, we now confirm that the pair will not have a strong opportunity for a bullish correction without crossing the 1.3300 resistance, which is unlikely until the end of this week’s trading. As for today's economic calendar data : From the U.K, all focus will be on BoE policy. From the United States, GDP growth rate and jobless claims will be announced.

      "WASHINGTON — The U.S. economy grew at a moderate 2.1% rate in the final three months of 2019, capping a year when growth slowed significantly due to a weaker global economy and trade war uncertainties.\n",
      "The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the fourth quarter increase in the gross domestic product, the economy’s total output of goods and services, matched the 2.1% gain of the third quarter. Both quarters were well below the 3.1% surge seen in the first quarter.\n",
      "For the October-December quarter, growth was supported by solid but slower consumer spending and an improvement in the trade deficit. Those factors offset a further drop in business investment in new plants and equipment and a slowdown in restocking store shelves.\n",
      "For the whole year, GDP increased 2.3%, the weakest performance in three years and a slowdown from a 2.9% gain in 2018 when the economy got a boost from President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and billions of dollars in increased government spending.\n",
      "Economists look for even slower growth in 2020 of around 1.8%. But that outcome could be threatened by various threats from a spreading coronavirus in China to a flare-up in trade tensions between the United States and China.\n",

      "Health officials say that the risk of contracting the illness (which is associated with cold and flu-like symptoms) in Canada is low. According to the Canadian Press, more than 7,700 people in China have been diagnosed with the new coronavirus and 170 of them have died.\n",

The statement says the petition specifically referred to families returning from China during the Lunar New Year.The statement points out that even traditional flu can be deadly for some Canadians.\"Influenza and pneumonia are ranked among the top 10 leading causes of death in Canada. Each year in Canada, it is estimated that influenza causes approximately12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths annually. No one has ever suggested that we should quarantine students for 17 days each time they have the flu,\" the statement reads. The groups are hoping to reassure residents, adding that the country's health care system is much better prepared to respond to the latest coronavirus outbreak than in 2003 with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\"The coronavirus is not isolated to people of one nationality or race. This is a world health issue that has its most serious impact in one area of China (Wuhan), but it has affected people of all different races,\" the statement reads. \"Some cases have been found in other parts of China and other parts of the world. East Asian Canadians were discriminated against during the SARS crisis despite the fact that the virus affected people of all races and nationalities.\"The statement points out that discrimination against East Asian people at the time of SARS did not make the public safer, adding that it isolated people, entrenched stereotypes, led to increased bullying in schools and spread fear of people of East Asian heritage. \"It is vital that we learn from the lessons of 2003 and apply them in how we treat each other today. Racism has no place in our society or in our classrooms.\" Trending\n",

But from the second flight we should see how we can properly confirm the health status of all evacuees.\"\n",

Both cases have no recent travel history to the virus-hit central Chinese city, and the Health Ministry said they were likely infected when travelling with the group of tourists.\n",

      "The National Institutes of Health projects that a vaccine it is working on with biotech company Moderna could be tested in humans in April. Scientists in Houston are pushing for another candidate vaccine — developed when a similar virus was the threat — to be thawed and formulated in vials for further testing. Yet another possible vaccine is being built at facilities in San Diego and Houston, with projections it could be tested in people by summer.\n",

      "PITTSFIELD — A new respiratory virus, believed to have potentially emerged from an animal source in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, has claimed the lives of dozens and resulted in hundreds of confirmed human infections. According to the state Department of Health, cases have now been seen in travelers from Wuhan to Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed five cases in the U.S., including Arizona, California, Illinois and Washington. Though the risk of exposure the new coronavirus from China has been deemed low in the commonwealth by health officials, the state Department of Health continues to work closely with the CDC to monitor the outbreak, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Health (DPH). As of Wednesday morning, there have been 68 confirmed negative cases and still 92 pending further investigation. There are also 36 states with patients under investigation, according to the CDC. There have been no confirmed cases in Massachusetts“ … The risk to Massachusetts residents from this novel coronavirus is currently low, however, this is the season for respiratory viruses including the flu and many of the same recommended precautions apply to coronaviruses,” said a DPH spokesperson in a statement. Locally, health institutions like Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield are heeding the cautions and taking the recommendations provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the World Health Organization, but are further tailoring the process to both hospital staff and patients. In 2015, Berkshire Medical Center established a policy covering pandemics, epidemics and outbreaks that cover the initial steps that would be taken for a new emerging disease, said Michael Perreault, director of infection control at Berkshire Medical Center.\n",

      "By Barbara Kollmeyer Markets reporter\n",
      "Economists began to lower growth assessments for China on Thursday amid the quickly spreading coronavirus outbreak, with Nomura analysts warning that “the worst has yet to come.”\n",
      "“Based on our study of the coronavirus’ characteristics and the Chinese government’s responses thus far, we reckon the coronavirus could deal a more severe blow to China’s economy in the near term relative to SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] in 2003,” said a team of analyst led by Ting Lu at Nomura, in a note to clients.\n",
      "That assessment came as the China death toll from the virus reached 170 and the number of infected climbed over 7,700. Global equity markets tumbled on Thursday as investors nervously awaited the outcome of an emergency World Health Organization meeting, where officials will determine whether an international emergency needs to be declared over the virus.\n",
      "Nomura’s Lu noted that the SARS outbreak triggered a 2 percentage point plunge in China’s gross domestic product from the first to second quarters of 2003. “Based on our assumptions, real GDP growth in [first quarter] 2020 could materially drop from the 6.0% pace achieved in [the fourth quarter of] 2019, on a scale perhaps bigger than 2pp registered during the SARS outbreak in 2003,” he said.\n",
      "Nomura’s Lu said he expects Beijing will introduce several measures to provide liquidity and support to the economy, notably business owners struggling amid the outbreak. He warned that the virus is still in the early stages of development, highlighting recent comments from the mayor of Wuhan—the virus’s believed epicenter—who said five million people left the city before its borders were closed.\n",
      "“Traffic flows will likely surge again in coming weeks when people return to work after the Lunar New Year holiday concludes,” he said. But Li added that the coronavirus may only prove a temporary shock and that could mean a V-shaped recovery due to strong pent-up demand and production. The scale of the slowdown and timing of that rebound hangs on the unfolding of the coronavirus, which remains an uncertain, he warned.\n",
      "Investors are anxiously awaiting the reopening of China’s stock markets next week. China’s CSI300 000300, -3.10% stock market closed down 3% on January 23 ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday—Taiwan’s stock exchange reopened from the holiday Thursday to a near 6% loss.\n",
      "Officials delayed the reopen of China’s financial markets until February 3 due to coronavirus concerns. The country has taken extraordinary measures, such as restricting travel and locking down cities, in an attempt to get the virus under control.\n",
      "Coronavirus cases have cropped up in Europe, Japan, the U.S. and elsewhere in Asia, as airlines have canceled flights and international and Chinese businesses keep workers at home to stop the spread of the virus.\n",
      "Also weighing in on the China economy was a team of economists at Citigroup, led by Li-Gang Liu, who said they expect much of the negative impact for China from the coronavirus to be concentrated in the first quarter, based on the SARS episode, but that the recovery from that may take longer.\n",
      "“We expect a sharp GDP slowdown to 4.8% year-over-year in [the first quarter], with a negative seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter growth. Given the importance of maintaining stability and the expected larger fiscal and monetary stimulus, we forecast full-year growth to slow to 5.5% [year-over-year] for 2020,” said Liu.\n",
      "The Citi team said China officials will have to break fiscal deficit rules and make policy more proactive to contain the virus’s spread and slow the economic downward spiral. And monetary policy will also need to become more accommodative, with necessary targeted reserve requirement ratio cuts to Hubei-based financial institutions and other regions that have been heavily hit.\n",
      "Expect, as well, a one-off policy rate cut in the first quarter by at least 15 basis points to ease interest rate payments for Chinese firms, especially smaller ones, alongside regulatory help for individuals and companies facing repayment difficulties, said the analyst.

There have been no deaths recorded outside of China.Tibet remains the only province that has not registered any cases, although it did report a first suspected case on Tuesday.Meanwhile, a Japanese government-chartered flight with 210 Japanese nationals on board arrived Thursday in Tokyo from Wuhan as part of the operation to evacuate hundreds of its citizens. The charter flight landed early in the day at Haneda Airport and is the same plane that brought 206 citizens home on Wednesday. Among those, three of them have tested positive for the coronavirus and two of the three were asymptomatic, said the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare on Thursday. Vietnam's National Administration of Tourism announced the country on Wednesday temporarily stopped receiving tourists from areas in China with confirmed outbreaks and was restricting the movements of Chinese tourists and those who have been to outbreak areas who are already in the country.The Japanese government is considering sending a third plane to repatriate the remaining citizens who requested to be evacuated from the country. A total of 650 Japanese have made the request.Outside of China, Hong Kong and Macau, other countries with confirmed cases include Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, South Korea, Japan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Canada, the United States, United Arab Emirates, Australia (two new cases reported Thursday), France and Germany. Finland reported its first case Wednesday. Several cases in Taiwan were also included in the national count.The symptoms of the new coronavirus, provisionally designated by the WHO as 2019-nCoV, are similar to those of cold but may be accompanied by fever and fatigue, dry cough and dyspnea (shortness of breath).

The World Health Organization will decide today whether to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency. The global health agency met twice last week but was split about whether to declare an emergency, saying it did not have enough information to decide. Such rulings can rally a global response, but also put countries at the center of any outbreak under even greater scrutiny. China said Thursday that the total number of deaths from the coronavirus had risen to 170, with cases now confirmed in every province and region in the country. More than 7,700 people have been sickened in mainland China, while 68 cases have been reported around the world. The W.H.O. has so far praised China’s response. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization’s director-general, met with Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, in Beijing on Tuesday.

      "Tweet: Huawei overtook Apple to become the world’s second best selling smartphone manufacturer in 2019, according to reports from Strategy Analytics , Counterpoint Research , and Canalys. Over the course of the year, the Chinese manufacturer reportedly shipped around 240 million phones, compared to just under 200 million for Apple. Samsung retained its comfortable lead in first place, shipping just shy of 300 million devices. Xiaomi and Oppo rounded out the list of the top five manufacturers.\n",
      "The jump is especially surprising given Huawei’s continued presence on the USA’s entity list, which prevents the company from installing Google’s apps and services on its new devices, limiting their appeal outside of China. As a result, Huawei’s main strength was in its home country. Counterpoint Research says China accounted for 60 percent of its sales, allowing its shipments worldwide to increase by 17 percent between 2018 and 2019 — though not in Q4 specifically.\n",
      "One report said that Huawei’s shipments grew by 17 percent between 2018 and 2019. Image: Canalys However, tensions with the US still had an effect. Canalys notes that 2019 could have been the year that Huawei challenged Samsung for the number one smartphone spot, but ultimately this challenge never materialized. It’s unclear when the situation could change in the future.\n",
      "Huawei has been nipping at Apple’s heels for a while. Back in 2017 Huawei initially overtook Apple to sell more smartphones in the months of June and July , and the following year IDC reported that it had sold more phones than Apple in the second quarter of the year. But in 2019, the company overtook Apple to sell more phones throughout the entire year.\n",
      "Although it lost out on the number two spot for 2019 as a whole, Apple had a very strong fourth quarter as is typical for the company. All three market analyst firms agreed that it managed to outsell Samsung in the last quarter, with sales being driven by the iPhone 11’s lower pricing in particular. Analysts said that Apple’s phone sales were up by between 7 and 11 percent in Q4 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018.\n",
      "Samsung is expected to rebound this quarter with the launch of its flagship Galaxy S20 series next month . Apple is also likely to receive a boost from the launch of its long-rumored successor to the more affordable iPhone SE , which could be popular in price-sensitive markets like India.\n",
      "Despite individual gains, all three reports agree that the industry sold fewer phones in 2019 than it did in 2018. Counterpoint Research notes that this is the first time the smartphone market has ever declined for two years in a row. With the US’s trade wars still ongoing, and China’s coronavirus scare having potential implications for supply chains, 2020 could be another challenging year.\n",

      "Last week, we asked our audience to share questions they might have about Wuhan coronavirus, the new respiratory virus that was identified in China.\n",
      "While there is a lot we don't know about the virus — how the disease first emerged, for example — there are things that we do know.\n",
      "Nearly 100 questions were submitted, on topics ranging from the name of the virus to whether it's safe to touch goods shipped from China. While there is a lot we don't know about the virus — how the disease first emerged, for example — there are questions that we can answer. Although sometimes the answer is \"We need more information.\"\n",
      "Here are some of the frequently asked questions, answered by NPR's Richard Harris and Elena Renken.\n",
      "What's the latest on the spread of this disease?\n",
      "As of Thursday, the latest figures now show more than 7,800 confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus and at least 170 deaths. The vast majority of these are in China. At least one case has been reported in at least 21 other countries or locales around the world. Five cases have been diagnosed in the U.S. — all among people who had recently been in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began in December 2019.\n",
      "What's the risk that it will spread within the United States?\n",
      "Health officials say there are likely to be more cases, especially from people who traveled to China. So far there's no indication that any of the U.S. patients have passed it along to others. The people at greatest risk would be health care workers who are caring for these patients — because of their continued exposure. But they are also on the highest alert and are taking precautions.\n",
      "If the virus spreads, how dangerous is it?\n",
      "According to reports in the journal The Lancet that came out a few days ago, it appears that only 3% of people who get sick actually die. And it's riskiest in older people in relatively poor health.\n",
      "But that 3% could well be revised to a higher number. The disease is so new that it's likely some people who have been sick could still die and that will change the mortality rate. As a point of comparison, about 10% of people who contracted a similar coronavirus, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), died as a result.\n",
      "There have been news reports that people can spread the virus before they actually show symptoms themselves. What's the latest on that?\n",
      "Yes, that would be an important factor in the spread of this disease. That kind of transmission happens with a lot of diseases, like measles and the flu, but it has not been the case with the most similar coronavirus disease, SARS. In a telephone news conference on Monday, Nancy Messonnier , director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, got a question on this point:\n",
      "\"We at CDC don't have any clear evidence of patients being infectious before symptom onset. However we are being — with our state and local health department partners — very aggressive and very cautious in tracking of close contacts to determine if we are able to identify any close contacts who indeed are ill. So far we have not seen any human to human transmission in the U.S.\"\n",
      "Respiratory diseases often spread through a cough, and that is, in fact, a symptom of this infection, along with fever and shortness of breath.\n",
      "How worried should we be about this coronavirus spreading in the U.S.?\n",
      "David Fisman , an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, told NPR this week that it will be hardest by far to get the epidemic under control in China, because there already are so many cases — and each one has the potential to spread the disease farther. He said trying to contain the epidemic in China is like being an outfielder and being told to catch 100 fly balls all at once.\n",
      "He says it's much easier to control the virus in the U.S. \"We're kind of getting knocked fly balls one at a time and the job is not to drop them. But that's much easier than playing catch-up when you've allowed the epidemic to grow to a point where you have thousands of cases, and now you're trying to track everyone down and prevent transmission,\" says Fisman.\n",
      "So at this point, the CDC's message is that this is a serious condition but that we in the United States are currently at very low risk. That is always subject to change, but as long as there are just a handful of cases, as is the case right now, health officials can stay on top of it. The trick is to identify sick people, isolate them quickly, keep an eye on their contacts, and make sure the health care providers are taking the right steps to protect themselves.\n",
      "Are health authorities in the U.S. reacting fast enough?\n",
      "The CDC very quickly devised a lab test to identify cases rapidly. Right now health departments around the country send samples to the CDC in Atlanta for analysis, but the CDC hopes to make its test available to labs nationwide in a week or two. That will make the response even faster. Health officials also have stepped up screening of passengers returning from China — these are now being conducted at 20 U.S. airports . And they are recommending against nonessential travel to China.\n",
      "I recently received something in the mail that I ordered from China. Could I catch the virus from it?\n",
      "There's no evidence at the moment to suggest that goods imported from China could transmit the virus, according to the CDC . The virus wouldn't make it through the trip from China to the United States on packing materials, says Ian Lipkin , director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at the Mailman School of Public Health.\n",
      "And the same goes for an object you might get in the mail, he adds. \"Whether it's a phone or a piece of furniture, it's not going to survive.\"\n",
      "The Wuhan virus, like others in the coronavirus family, \"doesn't live for very long on surfaces,\" he says.\n",
      "But that survival relies on certain qualities of the surroundings, says Amesh Adalja , a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security who focuses on infectious diseases. Some viruses last longer than others outside a body, and it depends on conditions, including surface material and temperature.\"Shipping conditions of most products are going to be not conducive to the virus remaining viable, because of time, because of temperature changes, because of humidity,\" he adds. \"I don't think it's a real risk.\"\n",
      "Why are people in the U.S. so worried about the coronavirus and not the flu?\n",
      "Simply put, the Wuhan coronavirus is new, says Lipkin. \"It's something that hasn't been seen before, and people are afraid of the unknown.\"\n",
      "The CDC says that the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus in the U.S. is low. So far, there have been five confirmed cases of the disease in the U.S. And all five had traveled previouslyto Wuhan.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the flu virus has been very active in the U.S. over the past few months. Already this season, the CDC estimates that more than 15 million people in the U.S. have gotten sick with flu, more than 150,000 Americans have been hospitalized, and more than 8,000 people have died from flu.\n",
      "Read more about the U.S. flu outbreak here .\n",
      "Why doesn't the coronavirus have a less technical name yet, like Ebola or Zika?\n",
      "The virus's temporary name, according to the World Health Organization, is 2019-nCoV. It's a combination of the year the virus first emerged and the abbreviation for \"novel coronavirus,\" a term indicating that the virus is a strain that has not been previously identified.\n",
      "The virus is also referred to as \"Wuhan coronavirus,\" after the city where it first emerged.\n",
      "Adalja anticipates that another name will emerge soon. \"This is a very new virus, and the virology community is trying to come up with a name for it,\" he says. But naming a virus requires great care, because there can be negative repercussions, he adds.\n",
      "In 2015, the WHO published a set of best practices for naming new infectious diseases in humans, encouraging scientists, government officials and media to avoid names with unnecessary negative impact. It advises against names that include locations, people's names, animals, foods and terms that create unnecessary fear.\n",
      "The WHO lists \"swine flu\" as an example to avoid. Adalja says the name was stigmatizing to pig farmers and influenced many people to stop eating pork, even though eating properly handled pork didn't put anyone at risk of getting infected.\n",
      "Whatever the name, a group called the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses will eventually make the call, says Lipkin.The ICTV decides names for categories of viruses that are agreed upon internationally. Any virologist can submit proposals, and the ICTV's executive committee will discuss them at its next meeting in October, according to its website .\n",

      "Fears are growing that the virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December and has since spread to 20 other countries and territories , could spread even further. The number of cases in mainland China shot up by 30% in just a day, reaching more than 7,700.\n",
      "More than 100 people have been infected outside mainland China in places across Asia, North America, Europe and the Middle East, with India and the Philippines the latest to confirm the virus had reached their shores. Most concerning, instances of human-to-human transmission have been reported overseas, including in Germany, the first such case in Europe.\n",
      "In Italy, meanwhile, the Costa Smeralda crusie ship is now docked at Civitavecchia port, a coastal town northwest of Rome. It had arrived from Palma de Majorca, Spain, as part of its tour of the western Mediterranean.\n",
      "A spokesperson for Costa Cruises told CNN that a 54-year-old woman aboard the cruise ship was suffering from a fever and that she and her husband were both being tested for the virus. Six thousand people on board are passengers and around another thousand are crew members.\n",
      "\"All the other passengers are, at the moment remaining on board,\" the spokesperson said. Italian news agency ANSA and public broadcaster RAI reported that the woman and her husband were from Hong Kong and were being kept separately in solitary confinement in the hospital section of the cruiseliner. The passengers and crew will be held until the woman and her husband both test negative to the virus.\n",
      "The couple is expected to receive results Thursday afternoon, ANSA reports. They are said to have arrived in Italy on January 25 at Milan's Malpensa airport from Macau.\n",
      "As the number of confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus continues to grow worldwide, the city at the heart of the outbreak marks a week since it was first placed under lockdown .\n",
      "All 31 provinces and regions within China have now reported cases of the virus, including Tibet, which had instituted strict checks on travelers and shutdown tourist sites in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to stop its spread to the region.\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) will meet again on Thursday to decide whether to declare the virus a global health emergency, something it has so far refrained from doing, despite widespread criticism. Borders close, foreigners leave\n",
      "Meanwhile, Russian state media reported Thursday that Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin had signed an order to close Russia's border with China in the Far East in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.\n",
      "\"An order has been signed today, it is in the works. Today we will inform everyone accordingly about the relevant measures to close the border in the Far Eastern region and other measures that have been taken by the government,\" Mishustin said, RIA reports.\n",
      "Russia's Far Eastern Federal District shares a land border with China, Mongolia and North Korea. Thursday's announcement comes after several Russian tour operators and charter flight companies suspended flights to China.\n",
      "Russia will also limit its railway service with China from Friday, TASS reported.\n",
      "In Hong Kong, where 10 cases have been confirmed, the government has closed a high-speed rail station that would usually connect the city to China's mainland.\n",
      "A CNN correspondent in Hong Kong spoke to people who had lined up for more than three hours to collect surgical face masks to help keep them safe from the virus.\n",
      "Several countries, including the United States, Japan and some in the European Union, are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan .\n",
      "Multiple major air carriers are also canceling flights to and from parts of China, including British Airways, American Airlines, Air Canada, KLM, Lufthansa and United. The moves follow travel guidance from multiple governments advising against \"nonessential\" travel to the country.\n",
      "The semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong has introduced new limits it says will cut the amount of mainland Chinese travelers coming to the city by 80%.\n",
      "Across Asia and elsewhere, strict checks and screening have been put in place for all travelers arriving from China -- though this may be ineffective as scientists previously warned that the virus can be spread while patients are asymptomatic. Quarantine city\n",
      "Some 60 million people across Hubei, the province of which Wuhan is the capital, are on some level of lockdown, and many travelers from the region have been ordered to self-quarantine, holed up in their apartments or hotel rooms for days on end.\n",
      "In Wuhan itself, 11 million people are marking a week on lockdown with no sign of immediate relief. Nor is there firm evidence that their sacrifice has been worth it, with the virus spreading around the country and scientists warning that other major cities could soon become self-sustaining epidemics.\n",
      "Online, people trapped in their houses have been uploading videos and photos showing various ways they are staying busy -- staging makeshift Lunar New Year lion dances in their apartments, exercising, and urging others to keep their spirits up. But as the lockdown stretches on, such positivity may be harder to come by, particularly as some begin to feel the lost wages or business.\n",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday ordered the People's Liberation Army to aid in \"winning the battle against the novel coronavirus epidemic.\" Military medical teams have already been sent to Wuhan and soldiers are also aiding with transporting supplies to the stricken city.\n",
      "Outside of Hubei, infections are predicted to continue growing for weeks, if not months. Researchers at Imperial College London have estimated that at least 4,000 people were infected in Wuhan by January 18, almost a week before the lockdown began. Their model suggests a low national figure of 20,000 infections by the end of the month, potentially as high as 100,000.\n",

      "By Kelli Bender January 31, 2020 03:35 PM\n",
      "On Thursday, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency as the coronavirus death toll and infection cases continue to rise around the world .\n",
      "In response to the outbreak and its international spread, several major airlines have suspended their flights to China , the country where this coronavirus outbreak originated , and countless individuals have bought up face masks as a way to protect themselves against the outbreak.\n",
      "Along with buying face masks for themselves, USA Today reports, many concerned about the coronavirus are also buying face masks for their dogs.\n",
      "“We had a 300% sale increase in Amazon, which led us to run out of inventory,” Kirby Holmes, owner of K9 Mask , told the outlet.\n",
      "A K9 Mask, according to Holmes, contains filters “designed using the exact recommendation the CDC suggests for humans to wear to protect against bacteria,” but the company can’t guarantee it will protect canines from the coronavirus outbreak.\n",
      "Anne Kimmerlein, DVM, MPVM, DACVPM — a veterinary epidemiologist for VCA Animal Hospitals — said that, as a vet, she “would not recommend face masks for dogs,” especially using face masks meant for humans on dogs.\n",
      "“While pictures of Chinese dogs wearing face masks are showing up online, there’s no scientific evidence that these masks protect dogs from either infectious diseases or air pollutant,” Kimmerlein told PEOPLE. “Dogs’ faces have a lot more variation than human faces do, meaning that a face mask designed to fit one type or breed of dog is unlikely to fit most others. Additionally, we cannot explain to a dog why we are putting something potentially scary or uncomfortable on their face.”\n",
      "In addition, it is also recommended that humans skip using face masks to protect against contracting coronavirus as well.\n",
      "“While it is cold and flu season, we don’t routinely recommend the use of face masks in the general public to prevent respiratory illness, and we certainly are not recommending that at this time for this new virus,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control, said in a statement.\n",
      "“Wearing a mask when you’re not sick has not been proven to help protect you with this kind of illness. It’s not something that I would do at this point unless you’re in an unusual situation where you’re around someone that you know is sick, but I wouldn’t recommend it,” Dr. Angela Hewlett, the medical director of the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit, told PEOPLE about why masks aren’t recommended for healthy individuals .\n",
      "Those worried about the coronavirus outbreak affecting their pets can take some solace in that, “according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is currently no evidence that dogs or cats can be infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),” Kimmerlein said, referring to the current outbreak by its unique name.\n",
      "RELATED: What to Know About the Mysterious Coronavirus Spreading in Asia — and How to Protect Yourself\n",
      "“While public health officials believe that 2019-nCoV probably originally emerged from an animal source, it now seems to be spreading from person-to-person. There is no reason to think that any animals or pets in the United States are at risk of contracting 2019-nCoV or are a source for infection,” she added.\n",
      "The veterinarian said, as a precaution, people traveling to China should avoid contact with both live and dead animals while there and keep up to date on the new information about the 2019 novel coronavirus by visiting the CDC’s website .\n",
      "While there is currently no evidence that the 2019 novel coronavirus can be transferred from humans to their pets and vice versa, Kimmerlein wants to remind pet owners that “there are other diseases that can be spread from people to pets and pets to people.”\n",
      "Image zoom\n",
      "VIKTOR DRACHEV/AFP via Getty “It is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets, especially those that do not belong to you. Other ways to avoid spreading disease between pets and people include making sure that your pets are up to date on their vaccinations and receive regular parasite control,” she advised. “Additionally, it is not a good idea to feed raw food to cats and dogs as this can put both pets and their owners at risk for common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella.”\n",
      "The 2019 novel coronavirus may not be affecting pets, but Kimmerlein said that “coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in several species of domestic and wild animals including cattle, horses, dogs, cats, ferrets, camels, bats, and others.” There is a coronavirus that affects dogs, known as canine coronavirus (CCoV), and a different coronavirus that affects cats called Feline coronavirus (FCoV). Both CCoV and FCoV are unconnected to the current coronavirus outbreak.\n",
      "“The most common symptom of CCoV is diarrhea, which may be accompanied by lethargy and decreased appetite. Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is often asymptomatic, but can cause mild diarrhea, especially in young kittens,” the veterinarian explained. “Rarely, a mutation of the virus can cause a disease called Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), which causes a severe inflammatory reaction in the abdomen, kidney, or brain. While a typical FCoV infection is mild, FIP is almost always fatal.”\n",
      "RELATED: Washing Your Hands for 20 Seconds Could Keep You Clear of Coronavirus and the Flu\n",
      "Overall, coronaviruses that affect cats and dogs often only create “mild clinical signs” and don’t require medical treatment. There are some cases that might require “supportive care, including replacement of lost fluids, nutritional support, and anti-nausea medication may be used for more severe cases,” Kimmerlein said\n",
      "“It’s important to remember that there are many causes of diarrhea in dogs and cats,” she added. “If your pet has diarrhea that does not resolve within twenty-four hours, is bloody, or is associated with significant lethargy or loss of appetite, it is important to see your veterinarian right away so that appropriate diagnosis and treatment can occur.”\n",
      "For those still concerned about the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infecting their pets, Kimmerlein provided this advice:\n",
      "“At this time, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is not a concern for pets in the United States. The best way to keep your pet healthy is regular veterinary care. Even if your pet is not showing any outward signs of disease, an annual physical exam with your veterinarian can help catch illness early and make treatment more effective. When your pet does become sick, don’t wait to see your veterinarian. In many cases, waiting until your pet’s symptoms are severe can make it that much more difficult and expensive to treat his or her illness. If you have questions about your pets, check out the AskVCA Youtube channel or talk to your regular veterinarian.”\n",

      "Tweet: Canada's top diplomat has gotten a nod from his Chinese counterpart to bring home nearly 200 Canadians from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, his office said Friday.\" data-reactid=\"22\">Ottawa (AFP) - Canada's top diplomat has gotten a nod from his Chinese counterpart to bring home nearly 200 Canadians from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, his office said Friday. In a rare telephone call with Foreign Minister Wang Yi Thursday night, Canada's Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne \"asked for the collaboration of the Chinese government in helping those Canadian citizens who want to depart the region.\" Wang \"responded positively,\" he said in a statement. Ottawa chartered a plane to bring back 196 Canadians who asked to be repatriated, but the airlift had remained in limbo this week even as the United States, Japan, South Korea and European nations brought home their nationals. With Wuhan locked down as part of a government effort to contain the epidemic, the Canadian flight required authorization to land in the region. Canada's relations with its second biggest trading partner have been strained since the arrest on a US warrant of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 during a flight stopover in Vancouver. China has detained two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, in apparent retaliation. It also blocked Canadian agricultural shipments. The first phase of a court hearing of a US request for Meng's extradition was held earlier this month, and is scheduled to resume in April. Kovrig and Spavor, meanwhile, remain in China's opaque penal system. Champagne's office said he also raised the plight of the detained Canadians with Wang, adding: \"The two agreed to remain in touch on issues of mutual importance.\" Also Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Donald Trump agreed in a telephone call \"on the need for (Kovrig and Spavor's) immediate release.\" Meanwhile, a 50-year-old Toronto man who had contracted the coronavirus during a trip to China -- Canada's first of several confirmed case -- has been released from hospital. \"Over the course of the week, his status continued to improve to the point where he no longer required in-patient care,\" Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre said in a statement. A fourth positive test of a student in her 20s who'd returned last week from Wuhan to London, Ontario was confirmed on Friday. She has recovered but remains in isolation. Reblog What to Read Next\n",

Updated: 2:40 PM CST Jan 31, 2020 Jocelyn Brumbaugh Several major airlines have announced decisions to temporarily suspend U.S. flights to China as the coronavirus continues to spread. Delta Airlines will temporarily suspend all U.S. flights to China beginning Feb. 6 through April 30 due to ongoing concerns related to the coronavirus, the company announced Friday morning. \"Between now and Feb. 5, Delta will continue to operate flights to ensure customers looking to exit China have options to do so,\" the announcement says.

      "Now, Rudyard Area Schools recently announced that they are closed for the rest of this week and will not return until Monday. Brimley Schools were also closed this past Tuesday and Wednesday due to excessive absences from flu and fever.\n",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Some people also may have vomiting and diarrhea. People may be infected with flu and have respiratory symptoms without a fever.”\n",
      "According to the Michigan Flu Focus, a weekly influenza surveillance report as released by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), Michigan’s influenza activity is considered to be widespread. This is considered the worst severity of influenza activity on the 5-tier scale. Michigan’s influenza-like-illness (ILI) rate as of December was 1.2 percent. ILI is defined as fever (temperature of 100 degrees or greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat without a known cause other than influenza, according to MDHHS. However, as of Jan. 18 Michigan’s ILI activity has nearly doubled at 2.2 percent.\n",
      "There have been approximately 54 pediatric deaths due to influenza just in the 2019-2020 flu season. According to the report, two pediatric Influenza B deaths have been confirmed by MDHHS this season alone.\n",
      "“The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have once again begun to release preliminary burden estimates for the 2019-2020 influenza season,” said DHHS in the report. “Between Oct. 1, 2019, through Jan. 18, 2020, it is estimated that there have been 15-21 million flu illnesses, 7-10 million flu medical visits 140,000-250, 000 flu hospitalizations, and 8,200-20,000 flu deaths (in the United States.)”\n",
      "The CDC recommends citizens to take three necessary courses of action when it comes to avoiding and limiting their exposure to influenza:\n",
      "First, “get the flu vaccine. It is considered the most important step in protecting against flu viruses. Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every year before flu activity begins in their community, before the end of October. Those most at risk for serious flu complications are young children, pregnant women, people with serious health conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart and lung disease), and people 65 years and older.”\n",
      "Secondly, “take preventative actions to stop the spread of germs. Clean and disinfected surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs like the flu. If you are sick with flu symptoms, the CDC recommends that you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities (your fever should be gone for 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medicine). Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.”\n",
      "Finally, “take flu antiviral drugs appropriately if your doctor prescribes them. Antiviral drugs are different from antibiotics. They are prescription medicines (pills, liquid or an inhaled powder) and are not available over-the-counter. Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting sick, but starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person has a high-risk factor or is very sick from flu. Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking this drug.”\n",
      "However, the flu is not the only illness Americans have been concerned about. As of Jan. 21, there was a confirmed case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Since then, there have been an additional four positive cases as of Jan. 27 — one in Arizona, two in California, one in Washington state, and one in Illinois. No known cases have been reported in Michigan.\n",
      "This respiratory illness was first identified in Wuhan, China. The cause of origin was originally anticipated to be an animal-to-person spread due to China’s large seafood and animal market. However, recent patients have not had exposure to animal markets, suggesting that this is a person-to-person spread. Symptoms can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath and may appear two-14 days after exposure. Because this virus is new, it is still being closely monitored and investigated by the CDC.

      "Tweet: \\n Hospital Authority Employees Alliance says its 13,000 members will vote if government does not close border with mainland \\n Union predicts nearly 10 per cent of workers at city’s public hospitals could take part \\n Hospital Authority Employees Alliance says its 13,000 members will vote if government does not close border with mainland, and union predicts nearly 10 per cent of workers at city’s public hospitals could join walkout. Thousands of doctors, nurses and other hospital staff in Hong Kong are threatening to go on strike next week if the government continues to ignore their demands to completely close the border with mainland China. A health workers’ union said on Friday that almost 7,000 public sector medical workers could take the drastic step if Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor did not act to combat the threat of the coronavirus outbreak. The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said the workers, accounting for about 8 per cent of all employees at public hospitals, had expressed their readiness to escalate industrial action if their call continued to fall on deaf ears. Winnie Yu Wai-ming, the alliance’s chairwoman, said its 13,000 members would vote on Saturday to decide whether to press ahead with the planned strike, which could start as early as Monday. “As medical staff, we never wish to resort to strike action to make our demands heard,” she said. “We hope the government will not back us into that desperate corner.” But Ivan Law, the group’s vice-chairman, said they would urge workers to return to work if the situation got worse and there was an outbreak in the community. Yu said the government’s plan to prevent a local outbreak, including asking mainland visitors to declare their medical history, had achieved little. “If the source of the pandemic is not put under control, with suspected cases pouring into Hong Kong, it matters not how many quarantine beds the authorities set up, or how much manpower we have,” she said. Yu revealed that of the 6,700 medical staff backing the action, 70 per cent were nurses, 8 per cent doctors, 13 per cent therapists, and the rest administrative and support staff. If members voted to strike, about 30 per cent of the 6,700 who work in non-essential areas would be the first batch to skip work on Monday. The rest would join a day later, the chairwoman added, if the government failed to reply to their demands. \\n Earlier this week the alliance demanded that the government close the border, arguing a failure to so would allow an influx of cases to jam the city’s public health care system, as well as compromising staff safety. On Thursday, a group of 403 Hong Kong West Cluster public hospital doctors and nurses, including renowned medical figures, also wrote to the government, demanding it close the border and also threatening industrial action. The Hospital Authority has asked to meet the alliance on Sunday and the union said it would decide whether to accept after Saturday’s vote. On Friday, Lam said she appreciated the workers’ concerns, but stressed that five of the 12 confirmed cases in the city involved residents rather than mainland visitors. When asked why she did not introduce measures to ban mainlanders, she cited the World Health Organisation, which warned against discriminatory action. But Law said they had never suggested stopping only mainlanders. He said all visitors coming from the mainland, regardless of nationality, should be stopped, as long as they are not Hong Kong residents. Law said the group expected any strike to be effective, as it would take up nearly 10 per cent of authority staff. However, he also said the group would not be able to protect staff from any disciplinary action the authority might take. “We can’t control them,” he said. As of Friday, Hong Kong had 12 confirmed cases, 11 of which involved patients entering Hong Kong from mainland China. The death toll in China has risen above 200, among its nearly 10,000 confirmed cases.\n",

      "Public Health England said there was no risk to wider members of the public, including to other patients at the hospital.\n",
      "Quick guide What is the coronavirus and should we be worried? Show Hide What is the virus causing illness in Wuhan?\n",
      "It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.\n",
      "What other coronaviruses have there been? Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\n",
      "What are the symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus? The virus causes pneumonia . Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.\n",
      "Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another? Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of January 30, the death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside China , in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have been two confirmed cases in the UK. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.\n",
      "How worried are the experts? There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown.\n",
      "At what point should you go to the doctor if you have a cough, say? Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.\n",
      "Should we panic? No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital.\n",

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday declared it an international public health emergency. Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, has been subject to an unprecedented lockdown, preventing residents from leaving in a bid to stop the deadly virus from spreading further. Thousands of foreigners were among millions of people confined in the metropolis, and numerous countries have begun airlifting their citizens out. A plane chartered by Britain to evacuate its citizens and other foreign nationals on Friday departed the city with 110 people aboard — 83 Britons and 27 foreigners. It will land at an air force base in central England at around 1:00pm (local time), with returning Britons to be isolated for 14 days at a medical facility in the northwest of England.

      "LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. businesses ended last year subdued, according to preliminary estimates for economic activity in the fourth quarter released by the government on Thursday.\n",
      "Real gross domestic product rose at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 2.1% in the three months from October to December, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported in an advanced estimate.\n",
      "Positive contributions came from lower imports (+1.3 percentage points), higher consumer spending (+1.2 points), faster government expenditures (+0.5 points) and a slight improvement in exports (+0.2 points).\n",
      "That helped offset a negative contribution to growth from a big drawdown in business inventories of raw materials, work in progress and unsold products (-1.1 percentage points).\n",
      "But a better measure of underlying domestic demand and economic momentum excludes volatile inventory changes, government spending and trade effects.\n",
      "Real final sales to private domestic purchasers increased at an annualised rate of just 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2019, the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2015 and before that the second quarter of 2013.\n",
      "Real private fixed non-residential investment in structures, equipment and intellectual property shrank at an annualised rate of 1.5%.\n",
      "Non-residential fixed investment has now declined for three quarters running, the longest downturn since the recession of 2008/09.\n",
      "Sluggish output growth is consistent with data showing relatively subdued rates of employment creation in the final three months of last year (https://tmsnrt.rs/38StcRo).\n",
      "U.S. manufacturing employment was up by just 0.5% in the three months from October to December compared with the same period a year earlier, the slowest rate of job creation for two and a half years.\n",
      "Private sector services suppliers increased employment by around 1.7% year-on-year in the final three months, little changed from earlier in the year, but a deceleration from 2016 and prior years.\n",
      "SLOWING MOMENTUM\n",
      "Employment in services tends to be less volatile than in manufacturing; the services sector effectively acts as a flywheel stabilising the labour market and the overall economy.\n",
      "And as services have increased their share of employment and GDP in recent decades, the business cycle has become more muted, with the exception of the deep recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008/09.\n",
      "Nonetheless, services employment and output tend to track changes in manufacturing and the two are not totally independent, so the slowdown in manufacturing job creation threatens to spread to the rest of the economy.\n",
      "The reasons are not hard to find. The U.S./China trade conflict, increased business uncertainty and a sharp slowdown in business investment spending all hit the economy hard in 2019.\n",
      "The resulting slowdown likely encouraged the White House to reach a phase one trade agreement with China to avoid it turning into an outright recession in 2020.\n",
      "But the economy finished the year on a relatively weak note, with business surveys, manufacturing production excluding motor vehicles, and now final domestic sales growth all decelerating to multi-year lows.\n",
      "Until recently, most investors and oil traders seemed convinced the fourth quarter would mark a turning point, with growth accelerating again following cuts in U.S. interest rates and the signing of a trade truce.\n",
      "However, data for the end of the year has been softer than anticipated and the outbreak of coronavirus in China has created greater uncertainty about the recovery of the global economy in the first half of 2020.\n",
      "Downgraded confidence in the recovery has now filtered through into a retreat in the major U.S. equity indices and a sharp drop in Brent prices, as traders mark down their forecasts for oil consumption growth this year.\n",

Pakistan said that quarantine regulations prevented it from flying out the more than 500 Pakistani students and their families from Wuhan. Bangladesh and India said they were putting aircraft on standby.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMuhammad Rauf, a master's student from Pakistan, told Reuters he and around 40 others were locked in their Wuhan dormitory for all but four hours a day.“How long will the lockdown be?... What will we do? Just count down our days?” he said, adding they had been calling for an evacuation plan from their government for ten days.Pakistani health minister Zafar Mirza said he understood students were anxious, there were no current plan to evacuate them - but the embassy was providing support.“We are following Chinese regulations according to which the whole place is under quarantine. As they open it, we will decide accordingly,” he told Reuters by phone.Another Pakistani student in Wuhan, who declined to be identified because he feared reprisals from authorities, said the students had been in contact with their embassy but it had not responded in two days.“They say that we cannot evacuate. Why can't they evacuate us? Other countries have evacuated,” he said. “We are thankful to the Chinese government ... but we are not the responsibility of the Chinese government. We are the responsibility of our government.”In one video posted on social media, a group of Pakistani students who said they were in Wuhan chanted “please save us” while one man asked the government to “take some measures to get us out of here”.\n",

      "Tweet: Commentary: Identifying the risk of coronavirus in Delaware Jan 30th, 2020 · Comments: 0\n",
      "By Dr. Karyl Rattay\n",
      "With recent cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) reported in several countries including the U.S., health officials across the nation, and here in Delaware, are increasing monitoring efforts to identify potential cases. The Division of Public Health (DPH) has posted information on its website https://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph and we are sharing information about 2019-nCoV and our activities related to the outbreak.\n",
      "While currently the risk to the general public is considered low, we consider any new infectious disease a serious concern and are working with health care providers to promptly identify and evaluate any suspected cases. It is important to recognize that the current investigation and response are dynamic, and frequently changing, and new information about the disease may impact the response. DPH will keep the public updated as the situation evolves. Dr. Karyl Rattay\n",
      "At this time, there are only a handful of confirmed cases in the U.S., and none in Delaware, though we recognize that could change at any time. DPH is investigating one potential case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in a Kent County resident. Test results are pending from the CDC and are expected in the coming days. The individual is currently hospitalized in isolation out of an abundance of caution. There is no widespread risk to hospital staff, patients or visitors, as all appropriate protective precautions are being taken at all hospitals statewide.\n",
      "Risk for contracting coronavirus is based on exposure. At this time, only those individuals with recent travel to China, or close contact with someone who has had recent travel and is ill, have an increased risk for becoming ill themselves. DPH is not currently recommending exclusion from work or school of asymptomatic persons arriving from China but employers should review their own procedures and staff responsibilities to determine the need for exclusion.\n",
      "For persons without an associated travel risk, it should be assumed that most respiratory illnesses are not the 2019 novel coronavirus. As you know, we are in the heart of flu and respiratory disease season, and with more than 2,000 cases statewide, Delawareans have a greater risk of contracting seasonal influenza than coronavirus.\n",
      "Symptoms of coronavirus are most similar to lower respiratory infections with patients having fever, cough, and shortness of breath. There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. While in some cases, illnesses can be severe and require hospitalization, many individuals infected with 2019-nCoV recover by resting, drinking plenty of liquids and taking pain and fever-reducing medications.\n",
      "Based on what has been learned from past outbreaks – including outbreaks of related coronaviruses – we know that finding cases quickly and responding to them effectively is key. That rapid response helps ensure that the ill person receives the care they need, and it lessens the chance of other people getting sick. Fortunately, Delaware has a strong disease surveillance system in place that includes partnerships with hospital and clinic systems as well as local health care providers.\n",
      "We have asked Delaware health care providers to alert us if a person with recent travel to China, becomes sick with respiratory symptoms. When cases are reported, laboratory samples are collected and submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for confirmatory testing. This testing can take several days.\n",
      "We have had a handful of calls from providers and have followed up. If at any point testing confirms a case of novel Coronavirus in a Delaware resident, the available details and protective recommendations would be shared with both the affected parties and the public as quickly as possible.\n",
      "Additionally, we have issued guidance to Emergency Medical Services responders regarding what to do if they are called to transport someone suspected to be infected with 2019-nCoV. DPH is holding frequent internal calls to ensure a constant flow of communication, and we are developing materials such as flyers to help the public understand what this virus is, and what they can do to protect themselves.\n",
      "When a new disease is circulating, it’s natural for people to ask what they can do to protect themselves and their families. The best guidance at this point is to take the same precautions recommended for avoiding colds and flu: People should stay home when they are sick, cover their cough and practice good hand washing.\n",
      "The CDC recommended that Americans avoid all nonessential travel to China. If you have recently returned from a trip to China and are feeling sick, call ahead to your health care provider and let them know of your travel and symptoms.\n",
      "I urge Delawareans to be vigilant and to stay informed. The Division of Public Health will share updates with you that will help to keep you and family healthy and safe. Together, we can prevent the spread of germs and make Delaware a healthier state overall.\n",
      "Dr. Karyl Rattay is the director of the Division of Public Health in the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services.\n",

      "Tweet:  TOKYO (Reuters) – Japan’s factory output fell at the fastest pace on record in October-December amid sluggish demand at home and abroad, reinforcing views the economy likely contracted in the fourth quarter.\n",
      "FILE PHOTO: Smoke rises from a factory during sunset at Keihin industrial zone in Kawasaki, Japan, January 16, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo Separate data showed retail sales fell for a third straight month in December, adding to worries about consumer spending after a sales tax increase in October.\n",
      "A growing virus outbreak in China is threatening to put more pressure on the Japanese economy. China is Japan’s second largest export market and Chinese account for 30% of all tourists visiting the country.\n",
      "Factory output fell 4.0% in October-December, the fastest pace of decline since comparable data began in 2013, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) showed on Friday.\n",
      "But in an encouraging sign, factory output grew 1.3% in December, compared with a median estimate for a 0.7% gain in a Reuters poll of economists. That followed a 1.0% decline in November and a 4.5% drop in October.\n",
      "And manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect production to rise 3.5% in January and grow 4.1% in February.\n",
      "The ministry kept its assessment of output, saying it is weakening.\n",
      "“The pace of rebound (in Dec) was not big… we will closely monitor whether factory output will recover in coming months,” a trade ministry official said.\n",
      "He also said manufacturers hadn’t factored in impacts from China’s coronavirus when they made production forecasts for January and February, so these numbers will need to be monitored.\n",
      "“The economy after the sales tax hike is expected to be weaker than previously projected as factory output and retail sales showed,” said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. “Global auto sales didn’t perform well, which weighed on Japan’s auto exports. There is a risk factory output of autos may not recover much.”\n",
      "There were some relief factors, such as a progress in the U.S.-China trade talks, which helped corporate sentiment and global recovery in the semiconductor sector, but risks remain.\n",
      "“China’s economy is expected to slow down due to the impacts from the virus in the current quarter, which could hit Japan’s exports,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. “There is a chance the economy in the first quarter may also shrink after an expected contraction in the fourth quarter, depending China’s situation.”\n",
      "Retail sales – a key gauge of private consumption – fell 2.6% in December from a year earlier, down for a third straight month and compared with a 1.8% decline expected by economists.\n",
      "The Bank of Japan last week kept policy steady and nudged up its growth forecasts, citing subsiding global risks. But Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stressed his resolve to keep policy ultra-loose amid lingering uncertainties.\n",
      "The government cut its assessment of capital spending in January for the first time in eight months due to softer global demand but said its overall view of the economy was unchanged from December.\n",
      "Analysts polled by Reuters this month forecast the economy contracted by an annualized 3.6% in October-December, but believe it will rebound modestly in the current quarter.\n",
      "Other data released on Friday showed Japan’s jobless rate stood at 2.2% in December, unchanged from November, around a three-decade low, and job availability also held steady at 1.57 per applicant.\n",
      "Tokyo’s core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose an annual 0.7% in January from a year earlier, less than the median estimate for a 0.8 percent annual increase.\n",

      "Domingo confirmed that the 38-year-old woman who came from Wuhan city, China, the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), before traveling to the Philippines, is confined at San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. READ: Philippines confirms first case of new coronavirus\n",
      "“We disclosed the hospital because every other hospital in Metro Manila were panicking,” Domingo said, referring to the statements released by private hospitals after the health agency announced the first case on Thursday. “To be assured that nothing is being hidden from them, we thought it was better to disclose.”\n",
      "Domingo said the patient was with her partner while she was touring the Philippines, specifically Cebu province and Dumaguete city before flying to Manila. The companion is also confined and was admitted in San Lazaro Hospital as a person under investigation (PUI).\n",
      "PUIs are patients who traveled to Wuhan recently and showed signs of illness. While the woman who tested positive for the new strain of coronavirus had mild cough when she was admitted, she is no longer showing symptoms.\n",
      "Domingo also assured the public that San Lazaro Hospital is “well-equipped” to contain the virus.\n",
      "“They have been handling infectious cases for the 400 years and everybody of course in the hospital knows that the patient is there,” he said of the government hospital, which was founded in the late 1500s.\n",
      "With two more PUIs added to the DOH list, there are now three patients in isolation at San Lazaro Hospital -- the first patient with the new coronavirus, her partner, and another foreigner who was recently admitted.\n",
      "There was another PUI confined at the same hospital but he died last Wednesday amid pending test results. The DOH is still waiting for the lab results to determine if the deceased patient has the new coronavirus or if he died because of complications from HIV-AIDS.\n",
      "Domingo also confirmed that the patient who tested positive for the 2019-nCoV ARD arrived in Cebu from Hong Kong on January 21 onboard a Cebu Pacific flight. She and her partner then took a CebGo flight to Dumaguete and from there took a Philippine Airlines flight to Manila.\n",
      "In a statement on Friday, Cebu Pacific said it is working closely with the DOH. “We are in the process of contacting passengers seated in the vicinity of the positive NCoV patient and are taking the necessary precautions to inform them so they can have themselves checked in case they show flu-like symptoms,” the company said.\n",
      "“The cabin crew and pilots on affected flights have also been informed and show no symptoms of illness,” it added. “The aircraft used for both flights have been pulled-out of the line and are undergoing thorough disinfection.”\n",
      "The DOH said its contact tracing procedure is being implemented. Its personnel will also be visiting the resorts that the patient stayed in.\n",

Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.” The warning was issued on the same day that the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency.\n",

      "Those being held at the base 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Los Angeles arrived Wednesday morning. They aren’t required to stay but had agreed to remain for at least 72 hours. Officials also can quarantine any of those evacuated on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "That happened to another American who tried to leave Wednesday night.\n",
      "Officials in Riverside County ordered the person quarantined for two weeks unless medically cleared sooner, said Jose Arballo Jr., a spokesman for the county’s public health agency.\n",
      "The order was issued “as a result of the unknown risk to the public” because the person had not undergone a complete health evaluation, the agency said.\n",
      "It can take up to 14 days for someone who is infected to develop symptoms, health officials believe. None of the Americans housed at base have shown symptoms of the virus since their arrival, Arballo said.\n",

      "Friends translated the news for Evans, who speaks no Chinese.\n",
      "“I stocked up on rice, noodles, water, anything that could help me survive for a week or two,” Evans said.\n",
      "The Chinese government shut down the city. Buses, trains, taxis, and personal cars were banned. The military patrolled some streets.\n",
      "“That’s when people, honestly, stayed locked in their homes,” Evans said.\n",
      "He compared the deserted city to an Old West ghost town.\n",
      "“I’ve never experienced anything like this before,” he said. “Imagine new York city being shut down. I was completely scared at first, because I didn’t know exactly what was going to happen. I don’t speak the language, and my family is so far away.”\n",
      "Evans holed up in his home for a week and a half until he received the news that the U.S. Embassy was evacuating its diplomats and their families and other U.S. citizens.\n",
      "He was notified that a chartered flight was carrying some of the 1,000 or so Americans in Wuhan back to the United States. The flight was coming in the next day.\n",
      "Evans said he was told, “If you can make it there, you’re on the flight.”\n",
      "“It was a race against time,” he said.\n",
      "Evans found an acquaintance who drove him to the airport. The embassy notified Chinese authorities of the license plate number so he could pass through the guarded streets.\n",
      "Evans said he was No. 171 out of 195 people permitted on board.\n",
      "On the plane were two men in full hazardous material suits, who warned them about the seriousness of the outbreak. Nobody appeared sick but all of the passengers decided to wear masks throughout the flight, Evans said.\n",
      "The plane flew to Anchorage, where the passengers had health screenings, and then landed at March Reserve Air Base on Wednesday morning. The U.S. arrival was joyful, Evans said.\n",
      "“We were clapping, smiling, laughing … there were cheers,” he said.\n",

The death toll stood at 213, including 43 new fatalities, all in China.The announcement came hours after the State Department issued a level 4 “Do Not Travel\" advisory, the highest grade of warning, and told Americans in China to consider departing using commercial means. \"Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice,\" the advisory said. On Friday, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines announced they were suspending all flights between the U.S. and China, joining several international carriers that have stopped flying to China as the virus outbreak continues to spread. Meanwhile, U.S. health officials issued a two-week quarantine order for the 195 Americans evacuated earlier this week from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. It was the first time a federal quarantine has been ordered since the 1960s, when one was enacted over concern about potential spread of smallpox, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\"We understand this action may seem drastic. We would rather be remembered for over-reacting than under-reacting,\" the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier said. None of the Americans being housed at a Southern California military base has shown signs of illness.China counted 9,692 confirmed cases Friday, the vast majority in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan, where the first illnesses were detected in December.The National Health Commission reported 171 cases have been \"cured and discharged from hospital.\" WHO has said most people who got the illness had milder cases, though 20% experienced severe symptoms. Symptoms include fever and cough, and in severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.China has placed more than 50 million people in the region under virtual quarantine, while foreign countries, companies and airlines have cut back severely on travel to China and quarantined those who recently passed through Wuhan. Infected people don't show symptoms immediately and may be able to pass on the virus before they appear sick. Since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December, at least 23 countries have reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and WHO noted with its emergency declaration Thursday it was especially concerned that some cases abroad also involved human-to-human transmission. It defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that poses a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.“The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. “Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.On Friday, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said it was authorizing the departure of family members and all non-emergency U.S. government employees from Beijing and the consulates in the cities of Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang. Staff from the Wuhan consulate departed earlier this week.The decision was made “out of an abundance of caution related to logistical disruptions stemming from restricted transportation and availability of appropriate health care,\" the embassy said.Mike Wester, a businessman in Beijing who has lived in China for 19 years, said he has no plans to leave.“I feel safer self-quarantining myself here at home than I do risking travel,” Wester said.He pointed to potential risks from crowds at airports and being required to remove a mask for passport and security checks.Japan and Germany also advised against non-essential travel and Britain did as well, except for Hong Kong and Macao. Popular holiday and shopping destination Singapore barred Chinese from traveling there, becoming the first Southeast Asian nation to do so.Tedros said WHO was not recommending limiting travel or trade to China.“There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,” he said. He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders.Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact, like within families, the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus is worrying.In Japan, a tour guide and bus driver became infected after escorting two tour groups from Wuhan. In Germany, five employees of a German auto parts supplier became ill after a Chinese colleague visited, including two who had no direct contact with the woman, who showed no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to China. On Friday, Germany confirmed a sixth case, a child of one of the people already infected.“That’s the kind of transmission chain that we don’t want to see,” said Marion Koopmans, an infectious diseases specialist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a member of WHO’s emergency committee.The new virus has now infected more people globally than were sickened during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a cousin of the new virus.

      "Update (1015ET) : Just minutes ago, The Lancet just noted that this new modelling study estimates 75,800 individuals in the Chinese city of Wuhan may have been infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as of January 25, 2020 – but authors caution that the true size of the epidemic remains unclear:\n",
      "“Not everyone infected with 2019-nCoV would require or seek medical attention. During the urgent demands of an expanding epidemic of a new virus, especially when system capacity is getting overwhelmed, some of those infected may be undercounted in official register.”\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,\n",
      "The World Health Organization says that we are facing an “unprecedented outbreak”, and they are basing that assessment on the official numbers that we have been given so far. But what if those numbers are not accurate and this outbreak is actually much, much worse than we have been led to believe? According to the Chinese government, there are now 9,692 confirmed coronavirus cases in China, and the official death toll has risen to 213.\n",
      "But the Wall Street Journal has already documented the fact that the death toll is being artificially suppressed . As I discussed the other day , many of those that have died are being categorized as dying from “severe pneumonia” so that they won’t count as coronavirus deaths. Meanwhile, it is becoming exceedingly clear that the number of confirmed cases is also much lower than it should be. Large numbers of victims are being classified as “suspected cases” even after it is quite obvious that they have the virus.\n",
      "CNN spoke to a Chinese woman named Shi Muying who has been told by her doctor that she has the coronravirus, but because a fourth test has not been administered yet she is still considered to be a “suspected case” …\n",
      "By January 26, Shi began to have a fever — one of the symptoms of the novel coronavirus. She went to the hospital’s fever clinic where she found over 20 patients, all waiting to be tested by one doctor.\n",
      "She says she was given three tests — a nasal swipe to rule out the flu, a CT scan to compare her lungs against those of infected patients, and a blood test. After nine hours of tests and waiting for results she says the doctor told her that she had coronavirus, but because he could not give her the fourth and most definitive test, she could only be considered a suspected patient. Her 67-year-old father is in the same situation.\n",
      "So this woman and her father do not count as confirmed cases at this point. Instead, they are among the 12,100 suspected cases that are still supposedly waiting to be confirmed.\n",
      "Of course Shi and her father were quite fortunate to actually be tested in the first place. Many others have visited hospital after hospital only to be turned away each time.\n",
      "The truth is that the Chinese medical system is simply unable to handle an outbreak of this magnitude. The hospitals are being absolutely flooded by very sick people, and there aren’t enough doctors or enough resources to deal with them all.\n",
      "According to a nurse that works at a hospital in Wuhan, what they are facing is truly a very desperate situation …\n",
      "According to a nurse in Wuhan who asked not to be identified for fear of professional repercussions, staff are overwhelmed, resources are running low, and there are no beds . There are so few hazmat suits that staff disinfect them at the end of their shift to wear again the next day, she said. Around 30 of the 500 medical staff at her hospital are now sick and admitted to hospital, and others — including her — have self-quarantined at home.\n",
      "“ There really are a lot of people who can’t get admitted , but there’s no point in blaming the nurses. There are no beds, no resources. Are we supposed to just fight this battle bare-handed?” she said. “Right now, loads of medical staff are at breaking point … I see my sisters charging toward the front line and I feel so powerless.”\n",
      "Will similar things start happening in other countries all over the globe?\n",
      "On Thursday, the number of confirmed cases outside of China surpassed 100 for the first time. The World Health Organization finally declared a global health emergency, and the head of the WHO warned that this is truly “an unprecedented outbreak” …\n",
      "“Over the past few weeks we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen that has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news conference at the organization’s Geneva headquarters on Thursday. “We must act together now to limit the spread.”\n",
      "Of course there has only been a handful of cases in the United States so far, and so most Americans are not really overly concerned about this crisis at this point.\n",
      "But if this virus continues to spread, that will soon change.\n",
      "Reuters interviewed a 21-year-old American-born college student that is living in Wuhan named Nicholas Schneider, and he told Reuters that he has been trying to find a way out of the city. Now that Wuhan has been totally locked down, he says that he feels “like I’m in an apocalypse somehow” …\n",
      "An eerie calm has descended on the normally bustling streets of the city of 11 million people, where Schneider has been studying geodesy – a branch of applied mathematics – at Wuhan University, about 10 miles (16 km) from where experts believe the new coronavirus originated in a market illegally trading in wildlife.\n",
      "“It’s like a ghost town, barely any people and cars. It’s a weird feeling. I feel like I’m in an apocalypse somehow,” said Schneider in a phone interview with Reuters on Wednesday.\n",
      "If this virus starts spreading like wildfire in the U.S., it is just a matter of time before U.S. cities are locked down in a similar manner.\n",
      "And will our medical system be able to handle a large scale outbreak?\n",
      "Certainly our system has more resources than China’s does, but the truth is that there aren’t enough hospital beds for all of us.\n",
      "In fact, right now there are less than a million hospital beds in the entire country.\n",
      "And there won’t be enough test kits for everyone either. So far, all testing in the U.S. has been done at the CDC, and officials are hoping to make test kits available to local communities soon.\n",
      "But what if thousands of sick people showed up at your local hospital demanding to be tested?\n",

      "IndiGo airlines has decided to suspend its flights on the Bengaluru-Hong Kong route and on the Delhi-Chengdu route from 1 February as the threat of novel coronavirus outbreak in China threatened to spread across nations. The low-cost carrier said for now, it will continue to operate the Kolkata-Guangzhou flight, which it is \"monitoring on a daily basis\". \"And for our operating crew, we are ensuring that they return to India on the inbound flights without any layover in China,\" the airline said in a statement. India's largest airline has also told its crew members, who are working on flights connecting India with East Asian countries like Thailand and Singapore, to wear N95 masks at all times when they are on ground. \"However, these crew members have been asked not to wear the mask when they are flying. They have also been told to avoid public places, meat from unverified sources and uncooked meat in East Asian cities. They have also been told to wash their hands frequently,\" the source added. According to an Air India official, all crew members working on flights between India and South East Asia have been asked to wear N95 masks. In India, many people are under observation in hospitals for suspected coronavirus infection, including in Maharashtra, Goa, Odisha and the national capital. People returning to the country after visiting China are being regularly screened for the deadly virus at airports across the country. In China, deaths due to coronavirus on Wednesday rose to 132, with the number of confirmed cases rising to 5,974 and the number of suspected cases to 9,239, as per figures released by the National Health Commission (NHC). \"After carefully assessing the current coronavirus situation in China, IndiGo is taking some safety measures for its customers, crew and staff. Due to China travel restrictions, we have seen a high number of cancellations from China on our Delhi-Chengdu route and vice versa,\" IndiGo said on Wednesday. \"Therefore, we are suspending our flights between Delhi and Chengdu from 1 February until 20 February. We are also suspending our Bengaluru- Hong Kong flight effective February 1,\" it added. The low-cost carrier stated that these are purely temporary and precautionary measures. \"We understand that these measures will cause inconvenience to our customers and we will be refunding the full amount to the impacted passengers,\" it clarified. IndiGo added that it is in \"close touch\" with the \"relevant government authorities\" and \"we thank them and our partners in China for all the help and support that they have extended so far\". Air India has kept a 423-seater jumbo plane ready in Mumbai to airlift Indian citizens from Wuhan city in China in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Wuhan is the capital of China's Hubei province. As India started the preparations to evacuate over 250 Indians, mostly students, stuck in the Hubei province, its embassy in Beijing said these nationals will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine on their return. And, amidst fears of contagion, British health authorities said hundreds of British citizens being flown back to the UK from Wuhan will be put in quarantine for two weeks. It comes as British Airways suspends all direct flights to and from mainland China because of the coronavirus outbreak. Australia, Japan, the US and EU nations are also repatriating citizens. Australia plans to quarantine its 600 returning citizens for two weeks on Christmas Island - some 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland. The UK government plans to fly 200 British citizens out from Wuhan, the centre of the new coronavirus outbreak, on Thursday. Sources told the BBC the returning Britons will be given the best possible medical care and advice. Those returning from other parts of China will not be affected, but have been advised to \"self-isolate\" for 14 days. In signs that the virus is spreading fast, four cases have been confirmed in Germany, making it the second European country to report cases, after France. The United Arab Emirates has also confirmed its first cases of the virus in a family who recently returned to the UAE from Wuhan. Confirmed cases were reported from 16 other countries. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) citing an expert at China’s National Health Commission as saying on Tuesday that it could take 10 more days for the outbreak to peak. Like the similar Sars and influenza viruses, the new coronavirus is a particular risk for elderly people and those with pre-existing illnesses. The sharp rise in cases is in part attributed to increased awareness, monitoring and testing in recent days. \n",

The rapid increase prompted Russia to close its long border with China on Thursday. The coronavirus has now been found in at least 20 countries since the outbreak began last month, with the Philippines and India being the latest countries to report cases. It's expected to keep growing: Respiratory virus experts in Hong Kong say they believe the outbreak's peak is still months away, likely in late spring. \"Ben Cowling, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, says that in the last few days the trajectory of this outbreak has grown much clearer,\" NPR's Jason Beaubien reports from Hong Kong. He adds, \"Cowling says the outbreak is just getting started, and he expects to see increased levels of transmission globally, including in the United States.\" There are concerns that a Chinese passenger aboard a cruise ship in Italy may have the coronavirus — a revelation that has kept more than 6,000 people on the ship while it sits at a port near Rome. Those aboard the ship, the Costa Smeralda, will remain in place until tests determine whether the passenger, a 54-year-old woman from Macau, is carrying the virus. The ship's medical staff placed the woman and her traveling companion into isolation in the Costa Smeralda's shipboard hospital Wednesday night after suspecting that she might have the coronavirus, Costa Cruises tells NPR. The company is a subsidiary of Carnival Cruise Line. The Costa Smeralda is on the last day of a seven-day roundtrip cruise in the western Mediterranean. It arrived back at its Italian home port of Civitavecchia Thursday morning after making stops in tourism-heavy areas such as Marseille, Barcelona and Mallorca. The Costa Smeralda is the cruise line's newest ship in the Mediterranean, having made its first cruise just before Christmas. President Trump has created a special task force to coordinate the U.S. response to the new coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. Led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, the group includes CDC Director Robert Redfield as well as other health, security and transportation officials. The World Health Organization says nations \"must be on alert\" to combat the coronavirus. \"Person-to-person transmission has been seen in at least 3 countries outside China — Japan, Vietnam and Germany,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said via Twitter on Thursday. WHO held an emergency session about the virus Thursday, its second such meeting in as many days as it weighs whether to designate the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency. The U.S. State Department is arranging further evacuation flights for Americans caught in Wuhan's virtual lockdown, with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing saying additional flights are tentatively set for Monday. About 200 Americans were brought to California on Wednesday, on a flight that included diplomats and their families. The new flights will have \"capacity for private U.S. citizens on a reimbursable basis,\" the State Department says. Nearly 82,000 people were under medical observation in China out of concern that they might have the virus, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention says. There are now more than 7,700 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China, where the illness has killed 170 people. The majority of the cases are in Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital. But at least 13 other Chinese provinces have confirmed 100 or more cases of people who have the coronavirus. Announcing Russia's decision to close its land border with China, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Thursday that the new restrictions will take effect Friday. Saying the well-being of the Russian people is his top priority, Mishustin said the temporary closures are the result of special circumstances created by the deadly illness. To reduce the chance of spreading any respiratory illness, the CDC recommends that people take simple steps such as washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoiding close contact with anyone who is sick.

      "DEADLY novel coronavirus (nCoV) that originated from Wuhan has claimed the lives of many in China and spread to at least 21 countries globally — causing the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a state of ‘public health emergency’.\n",
      "The Chinese government has been praised for its ‘swift, transparent and effective response’ to this outbreak.\n",
      "It is also not alone in its fight against the disease. Recently, tech companies worldwide have come out to support efforts to prevent the spread of the disease, bolster relief efforts, and also expedite vaccine development.\n",
      "Now, China’s largest tech companies, Alibaba and Baidu, have decided to contribute to China’s efforts in stopping the spread of coronavirus by lending their genome research capabilities.\n",
      "Alibaba Cloud, the cloud division of China ’s biggest e-commerce company, was the first to jump on the bandwagon. It had recently announced that it is offering its AI computing capabilities to scientific research institutions for free.\n",
      "Internet giant Baidu quickly followed suit and announced that its gene-sequencing algorithms and AI computing capacities will be available to scientists, free of charge.\n",
      "This is a significant development as the key to stopping this outbreak is not only to contain but also to find an effective vaccine and/or cure.\n",
      "Scientists at China’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have already mapped out the entire genome of the virus, a crucial step that would enable them to start the vaccine development process.\n",
      "Data of the genome sequence was also shared on a global database, allowing other countries such as Australia to participate in the race to develop a vaccine.\n",
      "Alibaba’s cloud division has been involved in genomic research since 2015.\n",
      "It has partnered with one of the world’s largest genomics organizations, the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), and provided them with powerful data analytics and computing power.\n",
      "The companies solidified their position as a genomics leader earlier this month by announcing that they completed a whole personal genome sequencing process within 15 minutes.\n",
      "BGI will also be selling coronavirus detection kits, which they claim can detect the virus within three hours.\n",
      "On the other hand, Baidu says it will be offering its LinearFold algorithm and AI computing capacity to aid R&D efforts.\n",
      "The coronavirus is an RNA virus, and has a genome similar to that of SARS and MERS viruses. RNA viruses also have higher mutation rates compared to DNA virus, making it difficult for vaccine development to keep pace.\n",
      "Baidu says that LinearFold will be able to predict RNA structure more quickly and accurately, thereby speeding up vaccine development. Soumik Roy | 30 September, 2019\n",
      "This is a stellar example of how breaking down barriers in technology can benefit mankind as a whole.\n",

      "The last time the WHO announced an international health emergency was in July 2019 over the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Before that, international emergencies were declared in 2016 for the Zika virus and in 2014 for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n",
      "The new coronavirus has sickened around 9,800 people worldwide and killed at least 213 , all of them in China.\n",
      "The WHO said in a statement that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.\n",
      "\"There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. WHO doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement,\" Tedros added. But the WHO also said that in certain circumstances, such as when there are many cases of transmission among a vulnerable population, such measures could be \"temporarily useful.\"\n",
      "The coronavirus drew worldwide attention after Chinese authorities began reporting cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan last month. They were able to pinpoint the cause to a previously unknown strain. Other forms of coronavirus, such as SARS and MERS, have been responsible for past international outbreaks.\n",
      "Health authorities believe this particular strain, known as 2019-nCoV, likely first spread from an animal. China's National Health Commission has said it is associated with exposure at a seafood market in Wuhan that also sold live animals.\n",
      "Since then, the virus has spread from Wuhan to countries around the world, including the United States, Japan, Singapore and Thailand. \"The vast majority of those cases are still associated with travel to Wuhan,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program.\n",
      "\"We know that this virus can cause severe disease and that it can kill, although for most people it causes milder symptoms,\" Tedros told reporters last week. The WHO said that about 20% of those infected experience severe illness .\n",
      "Experts find the new coronavirus particularly concerning for several reasons. First, the WHO said there is evidence that the virus could spread from human to human. \"The disease is mainly a respiratory disease passing via droplets from one person to another and mostly still through close contact,\" Ryan said.\n",
      "The droplets could come from sneezing, coughing or even talking. This is worrying because it is easier for a virus to spread quickly between humans compared with a virus transmitted from an animal to humans. Human-to-human transmission has now been documented in three countries outside China, Tedros said.\n",
      "Second, experts still don't know for certain what animal the virus originated from in Wuhan. \"Until we know what the animal is, there potentially could still be animals being sold in markets all across China that is spilling virus over into people,\" Matthew Frieman, a virologist with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, recently told NPR's Nurith Aizenman .\n",
      "And third, Chinese authorities say the virus has also infected medical workers — people who already would be taking serious precautions to protect themselves.\n",
      "There is currently no targeted drug to treat the virus, Chinese health authorities said. And there is no vaccine to guard against it. Tedros is calling on countries to \"accelerate the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\"\n",
      "Several countries, including the U.S., have started to evacuate citizens from Wuhan because of concerns about the coronavirus. As NPR's Bill Chappell reported , American passengers broke into cheers after their flight from Wuhan touched down Tuesday night in Alaska. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising that travelers \"avoid all nonessential travel to all of [China].\"\n",
      "Major airlines, such as United Airlines and British Airways, have suspended flights to Chinese cities.\n",
      "Chinese health authorities recently announced new sweeping measures to try to contain the new coronavirus by implementing a strict quarantine on Wuhan, a city of some 11 million people. \"There's no sense of when the quarantine might be lifted,\" NPR's Emily Feng reported from Beijing. \"The big problem is that people are going to have to return to work soon, when the Lunar New Year is over. Many of them are coming from villages where there are very few screening measures for the virus.\"\n",
      "China's government has come under criticism for not responding more quickly to the outbreak. But WHO officials have praised the Chinese response.\n",
      "\"The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak, despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the Chinese people,\" Tedros said. \"In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response.\" Copyright 2020 NPR.

      "\"We understand your concern, but respectable medical experts have determined that there is no need to panic because this could cause even greater losses,\" the letter said.\n",
      "The Embassy recalls that from the very first day of the Chinese New Year, Chinese President Xi Jinping has been chairing a meeting at which he gave comprehensive guidance, with the aim of strengthening epidemic prevention and control.\n",
      "Just two days later, on the third day of the Chinese New Year, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang traveled to Wuhan to learn about the activities being undertaken in the prevention and control of this epidemic. Currently, China is mobilizing the entire country to fight the epidemic and has taken decisive, effective and scientific prevention and control measures to prevent the spread of the virus.\n",
      "“We hope that you trust us. We have a system for the prevention and control of infectious diseases and extensive experience in dealing with public health issues we have gained in combating the SARS in 2003, as well as the scientific, technological and material bases we have accumulated over the past 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic China.\n",
      "Chinese scientists have already discovered the genome of the new coronavirus. Medical experts from all over China are constantly working on the ground to prevent and control the epidemic, it is stated in the letter to the BiH public.\n",
      "It is also emphasized that the City of Wuhan built a hospital within 10 days, solely to admit patients with the confirmed diagnosis.\n",
      "“We can confidently say that no other country in the world has such capacity for implementation, nor can it take such strong prevention and control measures in such a short time. We hope you will remain carefree. Adhering to the principles of openness and transparency, as well as a very responsible attitude towards global health security, the Chinese institutions have timely informed the World Health Organization, the relevant countries and regions of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan of the information on the epidemic, providim them with the genome of the new coronavirus,” it is said in the letter.\n",

      "He emphasized that the high speed and scale of Chinese action is rarely seen in the world, and expressed sincere belief that China will successfully control and defeat the epidemic.

      "The embassy also cites the words by a Bosnian sports professor and basketball coach Mirnas Avdić, who is in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, who stressed that there is no panic in China and that everything is under control.\n",
      "“The authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are actively taking appropriate measures. In this regard, the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in BiH is willing to maintain communication and cooperate with the authorities in BiH. So far, no confirmed or suspected case of this epidemic has been reported in BiH. Chinese citizens residing and working in Bosnia and Herzegovina, currently in China, have voluntarily proposed self-isolation initiatives and measures for a period of 15 days upon their return to BiH. Although they are not from the city of Wuhan, they have voluntarily proposed the implementation of appropriate prevention and control measures to alleviate the concerns of friends in BiH.

North Korea has postponed plans to tear down South Korean-made hotels and other facilities at the North’s Diamond Mountain resort to prevent the spread of a new virus that has reached the South after sickening thousands in China. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara, File) More SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea has postponed plans to tear down South Korean-made hotels and other facilities at the North’s Diamond Mountain resort to prevent the spread of a new virus that has reached the South after sickening thousands in China.\n",
      "The North’s decision, which was conveyed to the South through a fax message late Thursday, came as it intensifies precautions against the outbreak, including blocking tourists, reducing flights and mobilizing screening efforts in a nationwide campaign state media described as a matter of “national existence.”\n",
      "North Korea had earlier demanded South Korea send workers to Diamond Mountain at an agreed upon date to clear out the facilities.\n",
      "The South also on Thursday withdrew dozens of officials and workers from an inter-Korean liaison office in the North Korean border town of Kaesong, which the Koreas agreed to temporarily shut down until the outbreak is controlled.\n",
      "“At around 11 p.m. yesterday, North Korea through a direct telephone line between Seoul and Pyongyang ... informed its decision to temporarily suspend its plans to remove the facilities at the Diamond Mountain site,” said Yoh Sang-key, a spokesman from Seoul’s Unification Ministry. He said it wasn’t immediately clear when the Koreas would be able to resume discussions over the facilities.\n",
      "North Korea has yet to report any illness from the new type of coronavirus that was first detected last month in neighboring China. It has sickened thousands, most of them China, but South Korea has reported 11 cases.\n",
      "In November, North Korea said it issued an ultimatum to South Korea that it will tear down the South Korean properties at the Diamond Mountain resort if the South continues to ignore its demands to clear them out.\n",
      "That came weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the destruction of the South Korean facilities he described as “shabby” and “unpleasant-looking” while vowing that the North would redevelop the site on its own. Kim’s comments came after months of frustration over the South’s unwillingness to defy U.S.-led international sanctions against the North and resume South Korean tours at the site.\n",
      "South Korea had said it will prioritize protecting its property rights and seek “creative solutions” to problems in inter-Korean dialogue. But the North has so far rejected South Korean calls for face-to-face discussions or sending a delegation to inspect the site.\n",
      "South Korean tours to Diamond Mountain were a major symbol of cooperation between the rivals and a valuable cash source for the North's broken economy before the South suspended them in 2008 after a North Korean guard fatally shot a South Korean tourist.\n",
      "Seoul can't restart mass tours to Diamond Mountain or any other major inter-Korean economic activity without defying international sanctions against North Korea, which have been strengthened since 2016, when the North began accelerating its nuclear and missile tests.\n",
      "While U.N. sanctions don't directly ban tourism, they prohibit bulk cash transfers which can result from business activities like the Diamond Mountain tours.\n",
      "In their third summit in September 2018 in Pyongyang, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to restart South Korean tours to Diamond Mountain and normalize operations at an inter-Korean factory park in the North Korean border town of Kaesong, voicing optimism that sanctions could end and allow such projects.\n",
      "But without a breakthrough in larger nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang, the inter-Korean economic projects remain shelved. North Korea in recent months has suspended virtually all diplomacy and cooperation with the South while demanding Seoul break away from its ally Washington and restart inter-Korean economic activities.\n",

      "“The World Health Organization’s global emergency status is really … about helping countries that do not have the same level of sophistication as Canada, or perhaps the United States, to protect their citizens if in fact they have a citizen who returns from China who is ill, or has been close to someone who has returned from China who is ill,” Hajdu said in Ottawa.\n",
      "“You know this has been working very well in Canada, because we have actually been able to detect cases very quickly, support those people to get better and prevent the spread of disease.”\n",
      "The UN health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a co-ordinated response.\n",
      "Though many people experience only mild symptoms from the virus, China has reported more than 9,600 cases, including 213 deaths.\n",
      "Hajdu stressed the need and the responsibility to remain calm.\n",
      "“I think that anything that we are doing as politicians or leaders or members of the media that will create a sense of anxiety or panic is actually a dangerous road to travel down,” she said.\n",
      "Dr. Theresa Tam, chief public health officer, reiterated Thursday that the chances of an outbreak in Canada remain low.\n",
      "“Most cases and the spread of the novel coronavirus are occurring in affected areas in China with only three cases detected in Canada,” Tam said.\n",
      "“As well, all travel from China is now significantly diminished as a result of exit border measures by the Chinese government in the effort to contain the outbreak.”\n",
      "The Canadian government is advising Canadians to avoid non-essential travel to China and avoid all travel to the province of Hubei, which includes the city of Wuhan which is considered ground zero for the virus.\n",
      "Two confirmed cases are in Ontario and one is in British Columbia, which are all linked to recent travel in China. Tam said 101 people in Canada have been tested for the virus, with 58 testing negative for the respiratory illness.\n",
      "Tam also expressed concern about discrimination against Chinese-Canadians because of the virus.\n",
      "“It is understandable that our fears increase during times of uncertainty, but when this fear leads some people to spread stigmatizing stereotypes and misinformation, it only does harm,” she said.\n",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also warned against stigmatizing the Chinese-Canadian community.\n",
      "“We’ve seen too many instances of unreasonable fears being spread either on the internet or in other ways,” Trudeau said in Brampton, Ont. “We need to know this is a time for Canadians – all Canadians, including Canadians of Chinese origin – to pull together and to lean on each other.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, Tam said the Public Health Agency of Canada is working closely with Global Affairs, which is preparing to fly Canadians out of the Hubei province at the centre of the outbreak in China.\n",
      "Tam would not comment on whether those people would be quarantined once they arrive in Canada, saying more information would be provided when it’s available.\n",
      "Earlier Thursday, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health said the relatively low number of cases in the province is “reassuring.”\n",
      "Dr. David Williams said there are no new presumptive or confirmed cases in Ontario, adding that he would be much more concerned at this point if the province had already seen about seven to 10 cases.\n",
      "“This is reassuring in a way, but not that we’re going to sit back and coast,” he said. “The system is working. We’re investigating. Individuals of concern have self-reported, are coming forward and we haven’t seen ones that out of the blue show up already quite ill and infected. We’re not seeing that yet, but it’s still early days.”\n",
      "He said there are 27 cases under investigation in the province, and 38 people have already been tested and cleared.\n",
      "Williams said the coronavirus does not seem to be much different from regular influenza in terms of transmissibility, and evidence suggests it is not transmissible when a person is not feeling symptoms.\n",
      "In Quebec, there have been no confirmed cases of the virus, and the chances of its being transmitted to the community are considered low, the province’s director of public health said.\n",
      "Dr. Horacio Arruda warned the public against wearing masks, which he said “do not constitute, by science, a useful tool for the general population in Quebec, even in the context of a coronavirus outbreak.”\n",
      "Instead, he suggested people practice “respiratory hygiene” by washing their hands and covering their mouths when sneezing or coughing.\n",
      "If people have respiratory symptoms and have to go out in public, wearing a mask can help prevent transmission, Yaffe said, but it is not useful for the general population.\n",

      "Updated at 9:40 p.m. ET\n",
      "The World Health Organization announced Thursday that the outbreak of a deadly and fast-spreading strain of coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency.\n",
      "\"Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen, which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.\n",
      "However, Tedros was adamant that \"the main reason for the declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries. ... Let me be clear — this vote is not a declaration of no confidence in China.\" He said that the WHO is deeply concerned about what will happen if the virus begins spreading in countries with weak health systems and that the purpose of the declaration is to help those countries.\n",
      "The declaration of a global health emergency can work to galvanize international funding. According to the WHO's procedures , the three criteria for such a declaration are that it is an \"extraordinary event,\" that it \"constitute[s] a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease\" and that it \"potentially require[s] a coordinated international response.\"\n",
      "The last time the WHO announced an international health emergency was in July 2019 over the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Before that, international emergencies were declared in 2016 for the Zika virus and in 2014 for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n",
      "Also on Thursday, the U.S. State Department issued a \"do not travel\" advisory for China.\n",
      "\"Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China,\" the advisory reads. \"Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus.\"\n",
      "The new coronavirus has sickened around 9,800 people worldwide and killed at least 213 , all of them in China.\n",
      "The WHO said in a statement that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.\n",
      "\"There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. WHO doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement,\" Tedros added. But the WHO also said that in certain circumstances, such as when there are many cases of transmission among a vulnerable population, such measures could be \"temporarily useful.\"\n",
      "The coronavirus drew worldwide attention after Chinese authorities began reporting cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan last month. They were able to pinpoint the cause to a previously unknown strain. Other forms of coronavirus, such as SARS and MERS, have been responsible for past international outbreaks.\n",
      "Health authorities believe this particular strain, known as 2019-nCoV, likely first spread from an animal. China's National Health Commission has said it is associated with exposure at a seafood market in Wuhan that also sold live animals.\n",
      "Since then, the virus has spread from Wuhan to countries around the world, including the United States, Japan, Singapore and Thailand. \"The vast majority of those cases are still associated with travel to Wuhan,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program.\n",
      "\"We know that this virus can cause severe disease and that it can kill, although for most people it causes milder symptoms,\" Tedros told reporters last week. The WHO said that about 20% of those infected experience severe illness .\n",
      "Experts find the new coronavirus particularly concerning for several reasons. First, the WHO said there is evidence that the virus could spread from human to human. \"The disease is mainly a respiratory disease passing via droplets from one person to another and mostly still through close contact,\" Ryan said.\n",
      "The droplets could come from sneezing, coughing or even talking. This is worrying because it is easier for a virus to spread quickly between humans compared with a virus transmitted from an animal to humans. Human-to-human transmission has now been documented in three countries outside China, Tedros said.\n",
      "Second, experts still don't know for certain what animal the virus originated from in Wuhan. \"Until we know what the animal is, there potentially could still be animals being sold in markets all across China that is spilling virus over into people,\" Matthew Frieman, a virologist with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, recently told NPR's Nurith Aizenman .\n",
      "And third, Chinese authorities say the virus has also infected medical workers — people who already would be taking serious precautions to protect themselves.\n",
      "There is currently no targeted drug to treat the virus, Chinese health authorities said. And there is no vaccine to guard against it. Tedros is calling on countries to \"accelerate the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\"\n",
      "Several countries, including the U.S., have started to evacuate citizens from Wuhan because of concerns about the coronavirus. As NPR's Bill Chappell reported , American passengers broke into cheers after their flight from Wuhan touched down Tuesday night in Alaska. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising that travelers \"avoid all nonessential travel to all of [China].\"\n",
      "Major airlines, such as United Airlines and British Airways, have suspended flights to Chinese cities.\n",
      "Chinese health authorities recently announced new sweeping measures to try to contain the new coronavirus by implementing a strict quarantine on Wuhan, a city of some 11 million people. \"There's no sense of when the quarantine might be lifted,\" NPR's Emily Feng reported from Beijing. \"The big problem is that people are going to have to return to work soon, when the Lunar New Year is over. Many of them are coming from villages where there are very few screening measures for the virus.\"\n",

      "\"A broader spread of this disease has the potential to disrupt travel, trade and supply chains throughout Asia,\" said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University and the former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division.\n",
      "China has been through this before, in 2003, when the deadly SARS epidemic briefly interrupted the country's hard-charging ascent as an industrial powerhouse.\n",
      "Back then, consumer spending accounted for only one-fifth of China's growth, which was much more reliant on factory workers churning out goods for the outside world. Today, with many exporters who had factories in China having fled for cheaper pastures in Southeast Asia, about one-third of China's economic expansion is powered by consumer spending at home.\n",
      "While that's a sign of how much the Chinese economy has developed away from being the world's factory floor to rely more on its wealthier population, it also means bouncing back from the current outbreak may not be as easy as before. Consumers will hold back spending if the outbreak persists.\n",
      "Economic analysts say it's too soon to tell how much a financial shock is in store for China. The virus had infected more than 8,200 people in more than a dozen countries and killed at least 170 in China, as of Thursday.\n",

      "China's banking regulator has pledged to help businesses by lowering some interest rates and making it easier to apply for loans. Any major stimulus, however, will have to take into consideration China's surging debt of more than $40 trillion to fund massive infrastructure projects and prior loans to blunt the effects of the trade war with the United States. Since SARS, China's ratio of debt-to-gross domestic product, a key gauge, has doubled to more than 300%.\n",

Shares of Wynn Resorts plunged 10% and Las Vegas Sands Corp. shrank nearly 5% in that time. MGM Resorts International stock value plummeted more than 6% Monday before rebounding slightly.\n",

      "Tweet: The World Health Organization declared Thursday that the deadly outbreak fueled by a new coronavirus from China has become a global health emergency, citing fears that the microbe will soon reach smaller, poorer countries incapable of stemming its spread.\n",
      "The decision will probably make new resources available to health officials around the world who are battling a virus that has sickened more than 8,000 people on four continents and claimed 171 lives. It will also establish WHO’s authority to lead the international response and strengthen the organization’s hand in shaping the domestic decisions of its 194 member nations.\n",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization is not recommending any measures that would limit travel or international trade. Those are some of the most potent tools at his agency’s disposal to stem the spread of disease, but they are not necessary at this time, he told reporters in Geneva.\n",
      "But health experts acknowledged that WHO has no way to enforce its recommendations, or to constrain the actions of members. Even with the new declaration, the agency will be able to do little more than cajole and exhort the international community to cooperate, and to guide the efforts of philanthropies active in public health efforts.\n",
      "Tedros took pains to reassure China that WHO’s declaration implied no criticism of the country’s actions, including the “extraordinary measures” it has taken to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, known officially as 2019-nCoV. Among other things, the government ordered an unprecedented quarantine affecting 50 million people in 17 cities.\n",
      "“China is setting a new standard for outbreak response, and it’s not an exaggeration,” he said.\n",
      "But with the virus now present in 22 countries and territories, and with person-to-person transmission confirmed to have taken place in five countries besides China, the potential for it to cause mayhem in countries “with weaker public health systems” was Tedros’ chief concern.\n",
      "“We must all act together now to limit further spread,” he said.\n",
      "An expert advisory committee debated for almost eight hours before recommending that WHO formally declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. In doing so, the members recognized that the never-before-seen virus is spreading internationally, poses serious health threats, and could affect travel and trade.\n",
      "China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is being transmitted among people in China and have noted with concern several instances in other countries — including Japan, Germany, Canada, Vietnam and most recently the U.S. — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human spread.\n",
      "The circulation of a new virus across international borders, along with its transmission directly from person to person within several countries, are key milestones in the making of a public health emergency.\n",
      "The spread of 2019-nCoV in Vietnam, a country with a rudimentary system in place to detect, track and isolate new infections, is especially alarming to infectious disease experts.\n",
      "Tedros made clear that the step taken by WHO on Thursday must galvanize the international community’s efforts to help countries like Vietnam fight the spread of coronavirus.\n",
      "“We must support countries with weaker health systems” by providing them with tests that can quickly identify and treat those infected, he said. And when a vaccine to prevent infection becomes available, those countries must gain access to them, he added.\n",

      "Tweet: 4 mins ago No Comments 80 Subscribe Coronaviruses have caused three outbreaks in humans in the past 20 years: they were responsible for SARS in 2002, MERS in 2012, and the ongoing outbreak spreading rapidly through China and around the world. While finding ways to prevent and treat this new virus is the most pressing priority, in the long term, scientists have their eye on ways to prevent and treat any coronavirus — so that they’re prepared for the next one to come along. “This is not a one-off,” says Timothy Sheahan, a coronavirus expert and assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health. “This is something that will continue to happen in the future.” The new coronavirus is a dangerous public health problem for China and the rest of the world. But having another iteration of these viruses jump to humans does give scientists another important piece of data as they work to figure out treatments for this family of viruses. Coronaviruses circulate regularly in wild and domestic animals, but there’s a lot unknown about the properties that make them able to infect people. “The best information we have is to see which viruses end up being human coronaviruses and which are not,” Sheahan says. “Every time one of these jumps, it gives us another piece of that puzzle.” The ongoing outbreak also lends urgency to ongoing coronavirus work, and shows how important it is. Sheahan works on projects funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to identify antiviral drugs that can treat coronavirus infections. In the past few years, the teams have honed in on a drug called remdesivir, an antiviral developed by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. That drug was tested in humans as a treatment for Ebola in 2014 and 2015, and was found to be safe, even though it didn’t work well against that disease. READ ALSO: Is the coronavirus outbreak as bad as SARS? - Livescience.com “It’s a broad-spectrum antiviral, and it can work against a host of genetically unrelated viruses,” Sheahan says. In cells, it can block SERS, MERS, and other coronaviruses found in animals. In mice, it’s been effective in fighting off SARS and MERS infections. Just because remdesivir works in mice doesn’t mean it would work in humans, but it’s already been given to people during Ebola trials and health officials think it’s safe — so it could more rapidly be tested in patients who have the new coronavirus. Gilead said it would provide the drug to patients with the new coronavirus through compassionate use “where appropriate.” Remdesivir has not been approved by any regulatory bodies. There are other options for coronavirus treatments too. Back in 2003, preliminary studies showed that the combination of two antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, lopinavir and ritonavir, was effective in patients with SARS. Testing halted as the SARS outbreak subsided, but now the drugs are being tested in patients with the new coronavirus. “There could be universal antivirals against coronaviruses. There might already be one,” says Florian Krammer, a professor and vaccine development expert at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “Over time, we could have an even better one.” While an antiviral to treat coronavirus infections is tantalizingly in reach, creating a vaccine that could protect against any coronavirus — even before people get infected — is a bigger task. First, scientists need to develop a vaccine specific to the new coronavirus, Krammer says. “It doesn’t matter if it’s broadly protective,” he says. The important thing is stopping the spread of the current outbreak. “But in the long term,” he adds, “it would be good to have something that helps against any kind of coronavirus that comes along.” READ ALSO: New coronavirus may have started in bats. But how did it hop to humans? - Livescience.com A universal coronavirus vaccine isn’t impossible to imagine. Most coronaviruses have a bit of protein on their surface that they use to latch on to the cells they are infecting, and they bind to the same receptor on those cells’ surfaces. That’s a possible target for vaccine development, Krammer says. However, it could take years to create that kind of vaccine. Scientists have been working towards a universal flu vaccine for over a decade, and candidate drugs are only just entering early-stage clinical trials to test if they’re safe and work in humans. Efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine would run into some of the same problems faced in the flu research. Those efforts, though, would benefit from the experiences of researchers working on the flu. “A lot of the arsenal of weapons we have now could be used for coronavirus,” Krammer says. Treatments for active coronavirus infections and preventative tools like vaccines are both important public health tools that could help manage any new viruses that emerge in the future. A drug that could be quickly deployed in the event of an outbreak would address an immediate need, while a universal coronavirus vaccine could provide extended public health protection, Sheahan says. “They’re the short-term and the long-term goals.”\n",

      "As a fifth case of the coronavirus was confirmed in the U.S. on Monday, the mayor of Wuhan warned that the world should expect infections to keep climbing.\n",
      "On Sunday, Zhou Xianwang, the Mayor of Wuhan, said that 5 million people had left the city before travel restrictions were imposed ahead of the Chinese New Year . He said he expected at least 1,000 of some 3,000 suspected cases to be diagnosed with the highly-contagious virus.\n",
      "Ma Xiaowei, the director of China’s National Health Commission , said that the virus had an incubation period of 10 to 14 days, during which the virus can be contagious but the patients does not display symptoms. That would mark a major difference between the coronavirus and SARS.\n",
      "There’s speculation that the unusual eating habits of many Chinese may have caused this virus as it’s transmitted via bat.\n",
      "“From observations, the virus is capable of transmission even during incubation period,” Ma told a news conference, according to a report in the South China Morning Post . “Some patients have normal temperatures and there are many milder cases. There are hidden carriers.”\n",
      "The pneumonia-causing illness that infects the respiratory tract is now responsible for 80 deaths in China as of Sunday, up from 56 the day before, and more than 2,744 infections, up from 1,975 Saturday, health officials in China said.\n",
      "The new virus has also infected people in Hong Kong, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, France, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Macao and Nepal. The U.S. State Department ordered the evacuation of all U.S. personnel at the Consulate in Wuhan.\n",
      "The spread of the virus was likely helped by travel related to China’s Lunar New Year holiday, which began Friday. This week, officials in Wuhan, a city with 11 million residents, closed the area’s outgoing airport and railway stations, and suspended all public transport.\n",
      "Chinese officials have since expanded that travel ban to 16 surrounding cities with a combined population of more than 50 million people, including Huanggang, a neighboring city to Wuhan with 7.5 million people, effectively putting those cities on lockdown.\n",
      "The stock market does not like the unknown. It’s down 1.5% on Monday and probably won’t stabilize until the World Health Organization gets a handle on the virus. Travel companies are being hit especially hard.\n",
      "All of this highlights the importance of knowing who is coming into our country, and the dangers of an open border.\n",
      "Congressional members on the Democrat side have made their views on a secure border perfectly clear. They believe illegal immigrants will vote for them, so they don’t care who comes into the country as long as they get their vote. Bring crime, drugs, diseases, human trafficking, none of that matters as long as you vote Democrat. This is one of the reasons Jewish journalist, Laura Loomer, has decided to run for Congress. She’s running in President Trump’s home district to oust Pelosi crony, Lois Frankel. Loomer has been deplatformed for being the first to expose Ilhan Omar, a member of The Squad, as being anti-Jewish and pro- Sharia, so I have been promoting Loomer on social media since she can’t promote herself. On 12/28/19, President Trump retweeted a tweet of mine in support of her. Below are a couple of videos from her. If you want a fighter in Congress who is not afraid to stand up to The Swamp, you want to support Loomer, no matter where you live in the U.S. She’s been endorsed by Judge Jeanine, Michelle Malkin, Brandon Straka, and many more because of her willingness to fight the swamp.

      "-She’s the anti-AOC. Republicans NEED someone who will stand up to The Squad which is driving impeachment, anti Judeo-Christian agenda, and a full blown Communism agenda from the Democrats.\n",
      "-As Judge Jeanine said when endorsing her, “Laura Loomer stands up for what’s right regardless of the consequences.” This is VERY important because the reason Republicans and the MSM (even Fox) won’t stand up to certain issues is because they’re ‘afraid’ of the backlash. Advertisers dropping them & big money RINO donors dropping them are real consequences of standing up for what’s right. https://secure.lauraloomerforcongress.com/jr\n",
      "-You might say, “We’ve heard that before, and they get into Congress and become part of ‘The Swamp.’ You’re right in general. That does happen. Why do I think Laura Loomer is different? Because she’s already shown by ‘ACTIONS’ not empty words, that her word means something. She’s been deplatformed from social media, Uber, Uber eats, Lyft, Chase temporarily closed down her bank account, PayPal, Venmo, and many, many more sites for confronting crooked politicians and jihadists and calling them out.\n",

You might say, “Omar and Tlaib have broken many laws and will be arrested.” Again how long have we been saying Clinton, Comey, and the Deep State are still free. Who in Congress is screaming from the rooftops to arrest them? I’ll tell you, NO ONE. IF YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO IS LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP & WILL NOT BE COWTOWED BY THE PC POLICE, THEN YOU WANT LAURA LOOMER FOR CONGRESS-HANDS DOWN-NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE. https://secure.lauraloomerforcongress.com/jr\n",
      "–She’s going to FIGHT FOR free speech, for our 2A rights, she’s pro-life, pro-capitalism, pro-military, pro-Israel- pro-Judeo-Christian values, pro secure border (not in any order of importance), and most of all she’s pro- MAGA.\n",

      "I admit I am biased towards Laura Loomer because I have gotten to know her pretty well over the last year. BUT, I am more than twice Loomer’s age, so I am in general very cynical about politicians in general. As one donor said, “I have only donated to 2 people running for office, now President Trump and Laura Loomer because they stand up for the people regardless of the consequences.” Since I couldn’t say it any better myself, I thought I would add this. I have never volunteered to promote a politician, but I felt I needed to with Laura Loomer because she is someone who will definitely shake things up in DC. BUT she needs your help, because her opponent is heavily financed as she’s a 4x encumbent with a deep bank account. As Pelosi’s best friend, she has deep Democrat pockets funding her.

      "The headlines drew fast outrage. Readers accused the paper of utilizing ignorant and offensive language.\n",
      "“Yellow Peril” was an previous racist ideology that focused East Asians in Western nations. The phrase embodies the worst of anti-Asian fears and stereotypes, which have plagued immigrant communities because the first waves of Chinese language immigration to america started within the 19th century.\n",
      "Within the US, authorities propaganda and popular culture on the time unfold wildly racist and inaccurate photos of Chinese language individuals as unclean, uncivilized, immoral, and a menace to society.\n",
      "To invoke the time period now, in a narrative about dying and sickness in Asia, appears inconsiderate at greatest and blatantly racist at worst. The newspaper apologized rapidly and stated they’d no intention of perpetuating “racist stereotypes of Asians.” However the harm just isn’t so simply undone, and the paper just isn’t the only real wrongdoer — merely the newest in a wave of anti-Chinese language sentiment because the coronavirus spreads worldwide.\n",
      "The escalating international well being disaster has claimed greater than 200 lives — all in China — and contaminated near 10,000 individuals worldwide. As they search to comprise the virus, authorities in a number of nations are balancing the necessity for warnings towards the chance of making international panic.\n",

Some individuals in central China — the epicenter of the outbreak — are desperately taking any flight out, no matter vacation spot, as governments worldwide droop flights from China and impose restrictions on vacationers from the mainland.\n",
      "However the panic has additionally taken one other, extra acquainted kind — the re-emergence of previous racist tropes that painting Asians, their meals, and their customs as unsafe and unwelcome. As panic spreads, so does racism\n",
      "As information of the virus has unfold, many individuals of Asian descent residing overseas say they’ve been handled like strolling pathogens. Writing for the UK’s Guardian newspaper, one British-Chinese language journalist in London stated a person rapidly moved seats when he sat down on a bus.\n",
      "A Malaysian-Chinese language social employee skilled the identical factor on a London bus this week. “A pair individuals at an East London college I work in have requested me why Chinese language individuals eat bizarre meals once they comprehend it causes viruses,” she instructed Newpaper24. In Canada, there have been reviews of Chinese language kids being bullied or singled out at college. In New Zealand — the place there aren’t any confirmed coronavirus circumstances — a Singaporean lady says she was confronted and confronted racist harassment in a mall.\n",
      "These situations echo a protracted historical past of racism within the West. Throughout the Yellow Peril period, anti-Chinese language fears led to lynchings of Chinese language immigrants, racial violence, systemic discrimination — even an outright ban on Chinese language immigrants for 61 years within the US beneath the nation’s Exclusion Act.\n",
      "That is why the time period “Yellow Peril,” which comprises centuries of trauma, is so charged — and why using it in a recent headline was so beautiful. Nonetheless, this time round anti-Chinese language racism is spreading past the West. In Vietnam, indicators have been seen exterior eating places declaring “No Chinese language.” The vacationer who took the photograph instructed Newpaper24 the signal appeared up to now week. Comparable indicators have been additionally posted exterior a Japanese store, turning away Chinese language clients.

Concentrating on Chinese language meals\n",
      "Maybe probably the most widespread type of xenophobia is available in fearmongering, sensationalist stereotypes about Chinese language meals. The novel coronavirus is believed to have began in a Wuhan seafood and wildlife market, and scientists have pointed to bats and snakes as doable virus carriers. And whereas the wildlife commerce poses professional issues, the outbreak has prompted a racially tinged wave of disgust towards Chinese language meals, and anger from many who accuse Chinese language individuals of recklessly inflicting a possible international pandemic. “Due to some people in China who eat bizarre (meals) like bats, rats, and snakes, the whole world is about to undergo a plague,” stated one popular tweet . This concept has been bolstered by latest media protection of the coronavirus, a few of which has featured deceptive movies or pictures. One broadly shared video, of a Chinese language journey blogger consuming bat soup, was filmed three years in the past within the Pacific island nation of Palau, and the dish has been sampled by Western TV hosts up to now. The video and the blogger haven’t any connection to Wuhan or the present outbreak — however the video has gone viral nonetheless, with many Western viewers expressing horror on social media. There was such an uproar that the blogger got here ahead to apologize final week.\n",
      "What viral misinformation and breathless media protection usually miss is that solely a small minority of individuals in China really eat wild animals. Most individuals eat a lot of the identical stuff you would see in different cuisines, like pork or hen. In the end, what individuals wish to eat is culturally relative — numerous the Western disgust towards “bizarre” Chinese language meals is itself Eurocentric.\n",
      "That is to not say all criticism of Chinese language meals is invalid; the nation does have an issue with badly-regulated commerce of untamed animals, which has led to earlier outbreaks.\n",
      "The lethal 2003 outbreak of extreme acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was traced to the civet cat, thought of a delicacy in southern China. And although the federal government has launched some measures limiting wildlife commerce, it has been reluctant to take extra aggressive motion, and unlawful commerce continues.\n",
      "It is also troublesome to finish these practices due to the cultural significance and prevalence of conventional Chinese language drugs. Many of those wild animals are thought to carry necessary medicinal properties — as an example, individuals drink snake soup for arthritis and snake bile for a sore throat.\n",
      "There may be undoubtedly a bigger concern that must be addressed — how the federal government can stability custom with safer rules.\n",
      "However the beliefs and customs that drive consumption of those meals are centuries previous and interwoven in peoples’ lives — they aren’t really easy to undo, even much less so when they’re dismissed as primitive and unclean by international nations. ‘Standing with our Chinese language neighborhood’\n",
      "Proper now, we’re solely seeing early indicators of a xenophobic backlash towards the East Asian diaspora — tasteless jokes on-line, dangerous headlines, individuals performing fearfully in public. But when the 2003 SARS epidemic is any mannequin to go by, these strands of xenophobia may doubtlessly escalate into extra harmful, specific types of racism. On the peak of the 2003 outbreak, individuals of Asian descent have been handled like pariahs within the West. There have been reviews of white individuals protecting their faces within the presence of Asian coworkers, and actual property brokers who have been instructed to not serve Asian shoppers. Asian individuals suffered threats of eviction, had job provides rescinded with no rationalization, and a few Asian Canadian organizations acquired outright hate messages. Chinese language and Asian companies suffered heavy losses; in Boston, an April Idiot’s hoax falsely warned of contaminated staff at a Chinese language restaurant, reportedly inflicting a 70% drop within the restaurant’s enterprise. This all occurred 17 years in the past, when China was nonetheless slowly opening up. Now it is an rising superpower, and its position in a variety of latest conflicts — the continuing US-China commerce struggle, safety issues surrounding telecommunications firm Huawei, allegations of Chinese language spies in America and Australia — imply that many within the West already view China with higher suspicion and rigidity than they did earlier than.\n",
      "Add the specter of a world pandemic, and a wave of heightened discrimination might be even uglier this time round. Diaspora communities and native authorities are making ready for this, with many attempting to calm worry earlier than it turns into hysteria. In France, the newspaper controversy sparked a social media campaign , with many French Chinese language residents utilizing the hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus — I’m not a virus.\n",

But, the WHO declared the disease outbreak, a global health emergency \"not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries\", said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n",
      "\"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it\", said Dr. Tedros.\n",
      "Though majority of the 98 cases reported outside China are of those who had recently traveled to China, eight cases of human-to-human transmission have been confirmed by Japan, Vietnam, Germany and the United States. \"We must support countries with weaker health systems\", said Dr. Tedros.\n",
      "Low and middle-income countries often find it difficult to deal with disease outbreaks. Declaration of a global health emergency allows the WHO to support such countries to strengthen their disease surveillance and prepare them for cases.\n",
      "Declaring a \"public-health emergency of international concern\" (PHEIC) is the loudest alarm that WHO can ring, a step it reserves for events that pose a risk to multiple countries and that require a coordinated international response. \"Let me be clear: this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China\", he added.\n",
      "Global health emergency declared in the past WHO declares a Public Health Emergency of International Concern when there is \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease\".

      "The sheer growth in the Chinese economy over the last 17 years means the global health emergency triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, has far greater potential to gouge global growth, according to Warwick McKibbin, professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n",
      "\"It's just a mathematical thing,\" McKibbin said in a phone interview. \"Most of the GDP loss that we saw in the Sars model, and in reality, was China slowing down. And so, with China much bigger, you'd expect the billions would be much bigger.\"\n",

      "Bloomberg economists Chang Shu, Jamie Rush and Tom Orlik, said: \"Back in 2003, China accounted for just 4 per cent of global GDP. Fast forward to 2020, and its share has increased to 17 per cent. That means the global spillover if China's growth slumps will be larger.\n",

Here's what it could mean for the stock market. | Image: REUTERS / Denis Balibouse The World Health Organization officially declared a global health emergency Thursday. The coronavirus has spread to at least 18 countries. The stock market rallied Tuesday and Wednesday on the WHO’s reluctance to declare a crisis. But stocks tumbled Thursday after the CDC confirmed the first U.S. transmission of the virus. The latest escalation could be devastating.\n",

So far, coronavirus has infected over 8,000 people and killed at least 171 . It has spread to 18 other countries from China, where the coronavirus originated in the city of Wuhan, including India , the United States, France, and Germany.\n",

      "An end in sight to the U.S.-China trade war vastly improved the outlook for stocks going into 2020. It seemed like nothing could stop the stock market bulls from pushing the Dow to to 30,000 in no time. Not even an unsettling brush with a shooting war in the Middle East . But the stunningly fast spread of the coronavirus, and its serious deadliness, put the bull market on hold.\n",
      "The stock market went from euphoric to cautious in the second half of January as coronavirus spread. It rallied this week as the WHO hesitated to upgrade it from a regional to a global crisis . Now news reports show the virus spreading quickly all over the world. And health authorities are preparing for the worst. The market seems to be reflecting these fears as the major indexes struggled for direction.

      "BEIJING — The World Health Organization declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in China that has been exported to more than a dozen countries as a global emergency Thursday after the number of cases spiked tenfold in a week.\n",
      "The U.N. health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a co-ordinated international response.\n",
      "China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.\n",
      "Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading g among people in China and have noted with concern several instances in other countries – including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam – where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.\n",
      "The case in France is a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus and later became infected himself. The doctor is now being treated in an isolated room at a Paris hospital. Outbreak specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission.\n",
      "A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.\n",
      "On Thursday, China raised the death toll to 170 and more countries reported infections, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from China’s worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation.\n",
      "Russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak. It had been de facto closed because of the Lunar New Year holiday, but Russian authorities said the closure would be extended until March 1.\n",
      "Train traffic between the countries was halted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air traffic between the two countries continued, at least for now. Russia has not confirmed any cases of the virus.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus. The man in the U.S. is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak.\n",
      "There have been cases reported of the infectious virus spreading to others in a household or workplace in China and elsewhere. The case in South Korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier.\n",
      "The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, a cousin of the new virus.\n",
      "The latest figures for mainland China show an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,736 confirmed cases. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, and one was in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Outside China, there are 82 infections in 18 countries, according to WHO.\n",
      "China extended its Lunar New Year holiday to Sunday to try to keep people home, but the wave of returning travellers could potentially cause the virus to spread further.\n",
      "Transport ministry spokesman Wu Chungeng outlined a series of rigorous temperature checks and other “severe measures” to detect possibly infectious passengers. Transport restrictions such as those isolating Wuhan and suspending inter-provincial bus services would remain in place, Wu said.\n",
      "“It’s definitely very challenging, but we’re confident we can exert effective control,” Wu told reporters at the briefing.\n",
      "To date, about 99 per cent of the cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at two per cent, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it’s likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed.\n",
      "In comparison, the SARS virus killed about 10 per cent of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS.\n",
      "Chinese authorities have demanded anyone who travelled from or through Wuhan report to health authorities and self-quarantine themselves for 14 days, the maximum incubation period during which patients can be infectious even if they don’t show symptoms.\n",
      "China has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumours — a reflection of the one-party Communist state’s determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media.\n",
      "That stands in stark contrast to the initial response to SARS, when medical reports were hidden as state secrets. The delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide, killing around 800 people.\n",

      "The coronavirus has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. The number of confirmed cases jumped to 7,711, surpassing the 5,327 in mainland China from SARS. The virus has killed 170 people. The British and U.S. carriers on Wednesday joined several Asian carriers that are either suspending or significantly cutting back service there as fears spread about the coronavirus.\n",
      "Air India and South Korean budget carrier Seoul Air are also halting all flights to the country, and Indonesia’s Lion Air plans to do the same. Other carriers including Finnair, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, and Singapore-based Jetstar Asia are slashing service. Beyond disrupting travel, the move is heightening concerns about the broader economic impact of the virus outbreak. Hotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the industries suffering the most immediate repercussions, especially in countries close to China. The crisis has also begun to ripple through U.S. companies with operations in China.\n",
      "In a conference call Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company’s suppliers in China have been forced to delay reopening factories that closed for the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 10.

      "The airline operates daily flights from London’s Heathrow Airport to Shanghai and Beijing. It took the measure a day after Britain’s Foreign Office updated its travel advice on China, warning against “all but essential travel” to the mainland, not including Hong Kong and Macao.

      "American Airlines said Wednesday it will suspend flights between Los Angeles and both Shanghai and Beijing from Feb. 9 through Mar. 27. The airline cited “the significant decline in demand for travel to and from China.” Flights from Dallas-Fort Worth will continue, the airline said. China has cut off access to the central city of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, and 16 other cities to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. That has trapped more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. The outbreak has infected more than 6,000 on the mainland and abroad.\n",
      "Online flight notice boards for the Beijing and Shanghai airports showed numerous cancellations for both domestic and foreign airlines on Wednesday: -Air Seoul, a budget airline, became the first South Korean airline to suspend its fights to mainland Chinese destinations apart from Wuhan, stopping its flights to the cities of Zhangjiajie and Linyi.\n",

      "By IAN M. KAUKUI\n",
      "THE Ministry of Health and medical Service says it is waiting on cabinet to decide whether to ban incoming passengers from entering the country in light of the rapid spread of the coronavirus.\n",
      "The ministry has requested cabinet to make a decision on that.\n",
      "It says imposing a ban on incoming passengers is one of the measures that can be used to protect the country from the deadly disease.\n",
      "According to the ministry, all incoming international travellers are subjected to temperature checks on arrival and are required to complete a Traveller’s Public Health Declaration Card.\n",
      "However, until yesterday, the ministry is yet to get approval from the Cabinet that was supposed to meet yesterday regarding the submission.\n",
      "Minister Dickson Mua earlier said they want all incoming travelers who have been in China 15 days prior to their arrival here, are mandated to report to the Ministry of Health’s Public Health Emergency and Surveillance Unit if they develop acute respiratory infection and have symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing difficulty.\n",
      "Mua said the ministry is concerned about the spread of the disease and is doing all it can to stop the disease reaching the country.\n",
      "Meanwhile, over the few days the public continue to witness travellers entering the country especially by plane and nothing has been done to stop them or going through check-ups on arrival.\n",
      "The Solomon Star understands several other neighbouring countries have already banned flights coming from Asia.\n",
      "The coronavirus was first detected in China early this month and has since spread to over seven countries including our neighbour Australia.\n",
      "Meanwhile, an Ophthalmologist at the Eye Department at the NRH, Dr Claude Posala said in his facebook posting that during the most recent measles outbreak in Samoa, the ministry also requested cabinet to ban inbound measles suspects.\n",
      "He said interestingly, the submission did not go past the Attorney General's (AG) office to Cabinet due to issues and factors outside of the health arena.\n",
      "“Loss of business to aviation, airlines and seaports and such were some of the reasons stated through the office of the AG for the MHMS's travel ban submission not being granted.\n",
      "“Other reasons were financial loss to SIG due to travellers claiming compensation for flight and travel disruptions.\n",
      "“AG also highlighted that our current legislation does not protect or make SIG immune to any compensation claimants or such in such a travel ban scenario.\n",
      "“It would be interesting to see what Cabinet will decide on in today's session in regards to this current MHMS travel ban submission.\n",
      "“With the AG's response in the last measles outbreak travel ban submission, it would be prudent for AG and Cabinet to make a full disclosure to the public on the reasons and factors which are considered when making any decision,” Posala wrote.\n",

      "Tweet: * WHO declares coronavirus a global health emergency * Singapore posts biggest monthly drop since August * Malaysia closes at an eight-year low By Arpit Nayak Jan 31 (Reuters) - The Philippine and Vietnam indexes slumped over 2% on Friday, while other Southeast Asian stock markets also extended losses to close lower as fears about the spread of coronavirus triggered sell-offs across the region. The World Health Organisation on Thursday declared the virus a global health emergency, as the death toll surpassed the 200-mark in China while at least 22 other countries reported infections. Economists fear the hit to China's economy from the virus could result in a greater economic impact to the world's economy than that of the 2002/2003 Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) epidemic, since China's share of the global economy is now far greater. Fears of the spreading coronavirus in China - the region's largest trading partner - have knocked global stock markets over the past week. Transport, tourism, retail and luxury stocks have been at the frontline. The Philippine index tumbled for a fifth consecutive session to close at its lowest since Nov 2018, with financial and consumer sectors being the biggest drags. BDO Unibank shed about 4%, while conglomerate SM Investments lost 2.4%. Malaysian shares extended their losing streak to nine sessions and closed at an eight-year low. Thai stocks also ended weaker, with utilities and consumer sectors accounting for bulk of the losses, while the index posted its seventh monthly decline. Thailand's economy is expected to grow less than forecast this year due to coronavirus' impact on tourism, said a country official, after the trade-reliant economy reported a contraction in December exports earlier in the day. The Singapore index posted its biggest monthly drop since August, and recorded a weekly decline of 2.7%. Lender DBS Group Holdings ended 1.3% lower, while heavyweight Singapore Telecommunications shed 2.1%. Vietnam stocks came under pressure by a drop in financial and consumer sectors. The bourse lost 5.5% this week. Indonesia shares eased to an eight-month low, with Bank Central Asia and household goods maker Unilever Indonesia losing over 3% each.

      "Tweet: Ghana holds rate on balanced risks to growth, inflation January 31, 2020\n",
      "By CentralBankNews.info Ghana’s central bank left its monetary policy rate steady at 16.0 percent, citing balanced risks to inflation and economic growth. The Bank of Ghana (BOG) has maintained its rate since cutting it by 100 basis points in January 2019 as it gradually continued an easing cycle that began in November 2016. Since November 2019 the rate has been lowered by 10 percentage points. Growth in Ghana’s economy remains robust and broad-based although at a moderate pace relative to 2018, with consumer confidence rebounding and business“fairly optimistic,”BOG said. The latest composite index of economic acuity was up 3.1 percent year-on-year in November 2019 but down from 4,8 percent in the November 2018, with December confidence surveys showing a significant improvement in consumer confidence while business confidence softened due to exchange rate depreciation in November. Gross domestic product in the first three quarters of 2019 averaged 6.0 percent, almost unchanged from 6.1 percent in the same 2018 period, and overall growth for 2019 is projected to be close to 7.0 percent. The external sector remains strong, BOG said, noting the trade surplus had risen for the third consecutive year, helping narrow the current account deficit further to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2019 from 3.1 percent in 2018, and helping foreign reserves rise an additional US$1.3 billion to $8.4 billion at the end of December from $7.0 billion in December 2018. This should help ensure stability in the foreign exchange market where the cedi fell 12.9 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2019 compared with a 8.4 percent fall in 2018. But as of Jan. 29, BOG said the cedi had recovered, appreciating 0.3 percent compared with depreciation of 2.5 percent in the same 2019 period. Ghana’s inflation rate has been in single digits since June 2018 and recently remained steady around the central path of 8.0 percent, with various measures of underlying inflation well-contained. In December Ghana’s headline inflation rate eased to 7.9 percent from 8.2 percent in November.\n",
      "The Bank of Ghana released the following press release” “Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen of the media, and welcome to the first MPC press briefing for 2020. The MPC met during the week and deliberated on the recent global and domestic economic conditions, reviewed the latest macroeconomic projections, and subsequently took a decision on the positioning of the Monetary Policy Rate. I present to you the highlights of the meeting. There are signs of recovery in global growth, following an assessment by the IMF of a synchronised slowdown in global growth in the last quarter of 2019. Global growth is now projected to rise from an estimated 2.9 percent in 2019 to 3.3 percent in 2020, and 3.4 percent in 2021. The key risks to the global growth outlook are geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran and worsening of relations between the US and its trading partners with the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. The outbreak of the Coronavirus poses a new risk to the global economy and its impact is yet to be assessed. The Brexit finally takes effect today and is not expected to adversely affect the global economic outlook. Headline inflation in advanced and emerging market economies remained contained throughout 2019, reflecting moderated wage growth. In response to the low inflation environment, central banks in major advanced economies pursued accommodative monetary policy to support growth. For instance, the major central banks — US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, either cut or kept their policy rates unchanged in the second half of 2019. These policy actions contributed significantly to favourable global financing conditions with positive effects on capital flows to emerging and developing market economies as investors searched for higher yields. On the domestic front, headline inflation has remained in single digits since June 2018 and more recently remained steady around the central path of 8.0 percent. The two readings since the last MPC meeting showed that inflation increased to 8.2 percent in November from 7.7 percent in October 2019 due to upward adjustment in some administrative prices. However, it declined to 7.9 percent in December 2019 on the back of lower food prices amidst stable non-food prices. Alongside these trends, the various measures of underlying inflation remained well-contained and the Bank’s core inflation (defined to exclude energy and utility) has declined since June 2019, supported by well-anchored inflation expectations. The latest data from the Ghana Statistical Service point to firmer growth during 2019, although at a relatively slower pace than was recorded in 2018. GDP growth outturn for the first three quarters of 2019 averaged 6.0 percent, almost unchanged from the 6.1 percent recorded in the same period of 2018. Similarly, non-oil GDP growth averaged 5.0 percent against 5.9 percent over the same comparative periods. Overall, GDP growth for 2019 is projected to be close to the target of 7.0 percent. Similar to trends in GDP growth, the Bank of Ghana ’s updated Composite Index of Economic Activity (CIEA) recorded high growth, although at a slower pace than in 2018. The CIEA recorded 3.1 percent year-on-year growth in November 2019, compared with 4.8 percent in the same period of 2018. This was mainly supported by port activity, domestic VAT, and Deposit Money Banks ’ (DMBs) credit to the private sector. Results from the Bank ’s latest confidence surveys conducted in December 2019 showed significant improvement in consumer confidence reflecting optimism about current and future economic conditions. Business confidence, on the other hand, softened marginally on account of the exchange rate depreciation in November 2019. However, businesses expressed positive sentiments about industry prospects and declining interest rates. Growth in the key monetary aggregates firmed up in 2019, driven largely by increased accumulation of net foreign assets by the Bank of Ghana. Broad money supply (M2+) recorded an annual growth of 21.6 percent in December 2019 compared with 15.4 percent a year ago. The increase was mainly reflected in increased deposits, signifying deposit flight to quality, as the clean-up process boosted a return to confidence in the banking sector. DMBs ’ credit to the private and public sectors rebounded strongly in 2019. Private sector credit grew by 18.3 percent year-on-year to GH¢44.5 billion in December 2019, compared with 10.6 percent in December 2018. In real terms, private sector credit growth was 9.7 percent. Distribution of the credit was broad- based and almost all the key economic sectors recorded higher credit growth in 2019 relative to what was observed in 2018. The major sector beneficiaries were Services with 24.1 percent, Commerce and Finance with 20.9 percent, and Manufacturing with 10.9 percent. Supporting the rebound in credit growth, the Bank’s latest credit conditions survey conducted in December 2019 pointed to a net easing in overall credit stance to enterprises. The survey findings also showed that credit demand by enterprises would increase in the first quarter of this year. Underscoring these favourable survey results, the banking sector data showed a significant jump in new advances by 27.3 percent year-on-year to GH¢29.7 billion in 2019. The international commodities market remained buoyant, despite intermittent volatilities in the course of the year. Crude oil prices increased by 13.0 percent year-on-year, driven by OPEC production cuts and other geopolitical factors. Crude oil closed the year at an average of US$65.2 per barrel. Gold prices averaged US$1,481.3 per fine ounce, recording a year-on-year growth of 18.4 percent. The surge in gold prices was attributed mainly to the global economic slowdown and the low interest rate environment in major advanced countries. Cocoa prices averaged US$2,215.4 per tonne in 2019, an increase of 11.6 percent, due to the dry weather conditions which posed some threat to the quality of the bean. These price movements in the country’s key export commodities, together with increased export volumes, impacted positively on the external sector. In 2019, total exports increased by 4.6 percent year-on-year to US$15.6 billion, driven mainly by 14.6 percent growth in gold exports and 8.6 percent growth in cocoa beans and products. Imports, on the other hand, grew at a slower pace of 1.5 percent to US$13.3 billion on account of a 4.2 percent growth in non-oil imports, while oil and gas imports contracted by 9.2 percent. These developments resulted in a trade surplus of US$2.3 billion (3.4 percent of GDP) in 2019, compared with US$1.8 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) in the same period of 2018. The trade surplus, together with improvements in net current transfers, especially remittances, resulted in further narrowing of the current account deficit to US$1.7 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) in 2019, compared to a deficit of US$2.0 billion (3.1 percent of GDP) a year ago. The current account deficit was financed by significant inflows into the financial account, driven in large part by foreign direct investments and portfolio investments. Consequently, the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of US$1.3 billion (2.0 percent of GDP) over the review period, compared with a deficit of US$671.5 million in 2018. Gross International Reserves at the end of December 2019 was US$8.4 billion, providing cover for 4.0 months of imports of goods and services. The reserve level compares with a position of US$7.0 billion, equivalent to 3.6 months of import cover recorded at the end of December 2018. The Ghana cedi depreciated by 12.9 percent against the US dollar in 2019, compared with 8.4 percent depreciation in 2018. Against the British pound and Euro, the Ghana cedi cumulatively depreciated by 15.7 and 11.2 percent respectively, compared with 3.3 and 3.9 percent over the same period in 2018. By January 29, 2020, the Ghana cedi had recovered, appreciating by 0.3 percent compared with a depreciation of 2.5 percent in the same period of 2019. Provisional budget estimates from January to December 2019 indicated that total revenue and grants amounted to GH¢52.97 billion (15.3 percent of GDP) compared with the projected target of GH¢54.56 billion (15.8 percent of GDP). Total expenditures, including arrears clearance was GH¢67.67 billion (19.6 percent of GDP), below the target of GH¢70.19 billion (20.3 percent of GDP). These developments resulted in an overall fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) of 4.8 percent of GDP, slightly above the target of 4.7 percent of GDP but below the 5.0 percent fiscal rule. Inlinewiththesedevelopments,theprovisionalestimatesindicatethatthestock of public debt rose to 62.1 percent of GDP (GH¢214.9 billion), at the end of November 2019 compared with 57.9 percent of GDP (GH¢172.9 billion) at the end of November 2018. Of the total debt stock, domestic debt was GH¢102.9 billion, while external debt was GH¢111.9 billion with a share of 52.1 percent in the total public debt. Interest rates on the money market increased slightly across the various maturities of the yield curve. The 91-day Treasury bill rate inched up to 14.7 percent in December 2019 compared with 14.6 percent a year ago. Interest rates on the 182-day instrument also moved up to 15.2 percent, from 15.0 percent over the same period a year ago. In contrast, rates on the secondary bond market broadly declined. Yields on the 7 and 15-year bonds marginally declined to 21.0 and 19.9 percent in December 2019, from respective 21.0 and 21.4 percent in December 2018. The yield on the 10-year bond, however edged up slightly to 21.3 percent from 21.2 percent over the same review period. The weighted average interbank lending rate declined to 15.2 percent in December 2019, from 16.1 percent in the same period a year earlier. In a similar trend, average lending rates compiled from the banking sector marginally declined to 23.6 percent in December 2019, from 23.9 percent in December 2018. A year after the completion of the clean-up and recapitalization exercise, the performance of the banking sector has improved markedly, signifying positive dividends from the reform programme. Enforcement of the new Corporate Governance Directives issued by the Bank as part of the recent reforms led to several board chairs of banks and CEOs ending their tenure, while Board members who had served for prolonged periods were all replaced. The banking industry has built up a much stronger balance sheet and recorded strong asset growth, improved quality of loans and profitability during the year. All the financial soundness indicators, measured in terms of earnings, liquidity, and capital adequacy remained strong. Total assets of the banking sector increased to GH¢129.06 billion at end- December 2019, representing a 22.8 percent year-on-year growth. The increased total assets was on account of significant growth of 22.2 percent year- on-year in deposits to GH¢83.46 billion underscoring renewed confidence in the banking sector. The industry’s Capital Adequacy R atio, computed in accordance with the Capital Requirement Directive under the Basel II/III capital framework, stood at 17.5 percent at the end of December 2019, and above the 13 percent minimum regulatory benchmark. Asset quality also improved significantly and the NPL ratio declined sharply to 13.9 percent in December 2019 from 18.2 percent in December 2018, reflecting increased loan recoveries, write-offs, and higher credit growth.

As at December 2019, total active mobile money accounts stood at 14.5 million, up from 13.1 million a year earlier. Summary and Outlook 23. In sum, the Committee noted that the synchronised slowdown in the global economy during 2019 is beginning to give way to a recovery, mainly in the emerging market and developing economies and at a modest and uneven pace. The coordinated monetary policy responses of the major central banks to keep interest rates on hold and adopt a dovish monetary policy stance should benefit emerging market economies with solid macroeconomic fundamentals. On the domestic economy, the latest data from the Ghana Statistical Service and the Bank’s C omposite Index of Economic Activity both show that economic growth continues to remain robust and broad-based, although at a moderated pace relative to 2018. Consumer confidence has rebounded and businesses are fairly optimistic about industry prospects. Strong growth in monetary aggregates reflects significant pickup in aggregate demand, buoyed by a rebound in private sector credit, following the clean-up of the banking sector. Over the medium- term, growth will be supported by the services sector, especially as the banking sector continues to grow stronger and resilient, as well as the continued implementation of growth-oriented programmes in the industry and agricultural sectors of the economy. The external sector performance continued to remain strong, with an improved trade surplus for the third consecutive year. This contributed to further narrowing of the current account deficit and supported additional reserve build-up of US$1.3 billion. This should provide strong buffers to withstand shocks and ensure stability in the foreign exchange market. Fiscal policy has been a source of considerable stimulus. The 2019 budget execution was broadly in line with expectations with the budget deficit outturn almost on target and within the fiscal rule of 5.0 percent of GDP. While acknowledging that there are electoral cycle fiscal risks, strong commitment by the fiscal authorities to stay on the consolidation path should help sustain the stability and growth achieved over the past three years. Overall, the economy presents fairly resilient and robust performance with regards to output growth and a strong trade and payments position. The economy is positioned firmly on the path of stability with inflation forecasted to stay within the medium-term target band of 8 ± 2 percent, barring any unanticipated shocks. 28. Under these circumstances, the Committee viewed risks to the inflation and growth outlook as broadly balanced, and therefore decided to keep the Monetary Policy Rate unchanged at 16.0 percent, while standing ready to take decisive policy actions when necessary to ensure that inflation remains within the target band.\n",

      "( Natural News ) First it was Germany. Now, Taiwan and Japan are both reporting that coronavirus is spreading in their countries from person to person, debunking earlier claims that human-to-human transmission isn’t a major concern with this outbreak.\n",
      "Not long after German authorities confirmed that a Chinese woman passed coronavirus on to a male colleague of hers while in Germany, health officials both in Japan and Taiwan have now confirmed similar cases within their own borders, raising fears of exponential growth and a possible global pandemic.\n",
      "In Japan, a male bus driver in his 60s who hasn’t traveled to China anytime recently is said to have contracted coronavirus from one of his tourist passengers. In Taiwan, a 50-year-old man was infected by his wife after she returned from a work trip to China.\n",
      "This Taiwanese man is the eighth confirmed case of coronavirus in Taiwan, and the first known human-to-human transmission case in the island nation. Taiwanese officials have responded by telling people not to travel anywhere in China except for Hong Kong and Macau, after previously recommending against travel exclusively to the Hubei province where Wuhan is located.\n",
      "As for Japan, officials there have sent a plane to Wuhan to evacuate its citizens from the disease-stricken mega-city. The United States has reportedly done the same, followed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C.D.C.) issuing heightened warnings against all non-essential travel to China.\n",
      "To keep up with the latest coronavirus news, be sure to bookmark Outbreak.news . U.S. expands screening of travelers as coronavirus cases continue to soar\n",
      "The U.S. is also implementing expanding screening protocols for travelers arriving from Wuhan to some 20 airports and other ports of entry all across the country, up from five previously.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) has upped its global risk assessment for this coronavirus outbreak from “moderate” to “high,” though this was done quietly without an official announcement.\n",
      "At the same time, the W.H.O. continues to refuse declaring this coronavirus outbreak a global emergency, for which the agency has received much criticism. The official death count has now reached 130 people, with the official infection count steadily climbing well above 6,100.\n",
      "As for the evacuation flight of Americans from Wuhan, this C.D.C.-ordered flight that was originally supposed to land in San Francisco, but that was redirected to Ontario International Airport in Southern California, was redirected again to March Air Reserve Base, also in Southern California.\n",
      "The C.D.C. reportedly ordered this second diversion to the military base, but refused to publicly state why . The Department of Defense (D.O.D.), on the other hand, did issue a statement indicating that the Americans onboard the flight would be given housing at the base.\n",
      "“March Air Reserve Base and the Department of Defense stand ready to provide housing support to [the Department of Health and Human Services] as they work to handle the arrival of nearly 200 people, including Department of State employees, dependents and U.S. citizens evacuated from Wuhan, China,” stated D.O.D. press secretary Alyssa Farah.\n",
      "These individuals were supposed to have been kept in isolation at Ontario International Airport for anywhere from three days to two weeks as they were assessed for infection, this covering the upper end of the possible incubation period for the virus. But it’s now unclear whether the same procedure will occur at March Air Reserve Base.\n",

      "After 12 years at the helm of two G7 banks, Mr Carney leaves to become a UN-appointed envoy on climate change in March.\n",
      "Appearing in the ornate setting of the Bank of England for his last media briefing, he explained how the institutions could play a crucial role in fighting climate change.\n",
      "In December the bank announced that Britain’s top lenders and insurers should in 2021 be tested together for the first time to quantify the potential financial hit from climate change to their businesses.\n",
      "The results of the test are due to be published in April 2021 and in the meantime, the bank has asked for industry feedback.\n",
      "Mr Carney said the feedback was continuing, and that major banks and insurers are “very engaged” with these new stress tests.\n",
      "He said that the December announcement has prompted other central banks to follow suit.\n",
      "“It’s important to emphasise that these are not ‘gotcha’ stress tests,\" Mr Carney said.\n",
      "\"They are not stress tests that lead to a change in the capital ratios of the banks or the risk-related assets of the institutions.\n",
      "\"They are really stress tests about the strategy of the institution, given the rising physical consequences of climate change.\"\n",

      "The bank’s monetary policy meeting on Thursday came at a pivotal time for Britain’s economy, only a day before the UK was due to leave the EU.\n",
      "“UK is entering a decade of profound structural change,” Mr Carney said.\n",
      "“New trading arrangements will be struck, a new immigration policy will be introduced, major initiatives will be likely on infrastructure and regional develop and the transition to a low carbon economy.”\n",
      "He said he had no regrets as far as monetary policy was concerned during his tenure as governor, but Mr Carney was not popular in all circles.\n",
      "He has been criticised by some as being \"too political” and part of “project fear” when it came to forecasting the economic impact of Britain’s departure from the EU.\n",
      "‘The unreliable boyfriend’ Unusually for a Bank of England governor, he has experience in leading another central bank, the Bank of Canada, which he steered through the global financial crisis.\n",
      "Since holding the BoE's top job, he has in some circles earned the reputation of being ‘the unreliable boyfriend’, because of his tendency to moot interest rate rises and cuts before pulling back.\n",
      "Before Thursday’s announcement by the bank to hold interest rates at 0.75 per cent (7-2 vote), the market was split on whether they would be cut or maintained.\n",
      "Critics say Mr Carney he tends to confuse the City and many are sceptical of his flagship forward guidance policy, which he introduced in 2013.\n",
      "The guidance is supposed to give an indication of when the committee would raise rates, but under Mr Carney it has often not done this.\n",
      "But on Thursday he staunchly defended the policy, saying it was “a key part of the armoury” and that “the jury was in” that these forecasts work.\n",
      "Having inherited an economy facing stagnant growth after the Brexit referendum, in Mr Carney’s tenure of six and half years, his committee tweaked interest rates three times over 69 meetings.\n",
      "The first shift was a quarter-point cut to new record lows of 0.25 per cent back in August 2016, but since there have been two quarter-point increases.\n",
      "Such low interest rates became the new normal.\n",
      "On Thursday, the bank was a long way off its inflation target of 2 per cent, hitting 1.4 per cent in the final quarter of 2019.\n",
      "Mr Carney said that a \"moderate tightening\" of monetary policy may be required to meet its inflation target in the future.\n",
      "His decision not to cut rates on his last meeting may cause a headache for his successor, Andrew Bailey, who may have to do so to keep inflation high enough as he assumes his new role.\n",

The Costa Crociere company's ship Costa Smeralda docked in Civitavecchia, north of Rome, with about 6000 people aboard, including 27 Australians. The mayor of the town had asked authorities to prevent passengers from disembarking until it had been confirmed the virus was not present.

      "MOSCOW, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble firmed slightly on Friday, recovering from seven-week lows against the dollar it hit the day before as investors monitored news about the new coronavirus in China and swings in oil prices. At 0803 GMT, the rouble was 0.2% stronger against the dollar at 63.14 , having stepped away from its weakest level since Dec. 11 of 63.51 it briefly touched on Thursday. Against the euro, the rouble was 0.3% stronger at 69.64 after hitting 70.07 on Thursday, a level last seen in mid-December. The outbreak of the coronavirus remains in focus as its death toll topped 200 and the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global health emergency, boosting concerns about the economic implications.

[nL8N29Z3Q8] \"The rouble volatility has increased amid this backdrop, but its weakening is not threatening as the rouble just got back to levels of December 2019,\" Rosbank said in a note. \"We still expect the rouble rate to stabilise in the range of 61.5-62.5 (versus the dollar) on a one-month horizon.\" Oil prices rose on Friday following sharp losses this week, with Brent crude oil , a global benchmark for Russia's main export, gaining 1.1% to $58.91 a barrel. Tracking moves in oil prices, the dollar-denominated RTS index was up 1.2% to 1,562.5 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 0.8% higher at 3,131.9 points.

      "The primary reason there is a shortage of natural gas in Australia is the long-term contract signed by John Howard in 2002 locking us in as a supplier to China for 25 years (\" State hits the gas with $3b deal \", January 31). We are now the largest supplier of LNG in the world. The problem is that we are getting a very low price for our exports. This also reduces domestic supply driving our prices up.\n",
      "The solution, late in the day, is to bribe the states to increase gas supply. The great economic managers are letting us down: Howard with an immediate cash grab in 2002 and Scott Morrison with a half-baked plan to reduce carbon emissions by encouraging NSW to destroy water supplies and farmland by fracking the daylights out of our once beautiful country. - Chris Moe, Bensville\n",
      "Fracking is not, as claimed, a \"transitional\" fuel because gas is simply another form of fossil fuel. Fracking has many dangerous drawbacks: it requires huge amounts of energy, releases CO2, uses huge amounts of water, and contaminates groundwater and introduces carcinogenic chemicals making it unusable forever. Climate change demands a true transition to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, wave and other innovative forms of non-polluting energy. - Michael Davis, Balmain East\n",
      "Listening to the PM and reading Innes Willox of the Australian Industry Group, it's mystifying that the self-proclaimed advocates of free enterprise are still obsessed by the cost of addressing climate change rather than embracing the opportunity and profits of making Australia the industrial centre of the post-carbon world fuelled by renewable energy (\" Getting down to climate business\" , January 31). - Michael Berg, Randwick\n",
      "Advertisement Scorning pleas from business, science and citizens to make a genuine commitment to renewable power, our state and federal leaders announce billions of dollars worth of taxpayers' money for yet more fossil-fuel power generation. Per capita, Australians are still one of the biggest emitters of CO2 in the world. Short-term thinking is running up a CO2 bill that not even our children will be able to repay. We need true visionaries who will genuinely care about our national wellbeing. - Bruce Spence, Balmain\n",
      "It is hypocritical for the federal government to plan more fracking in the eastern states in exchange for matched funding for renewables. Poisoning our underground water reserves to harvest gas, that is to sell more fossil fuels, is the last thing our community needs. One step forward two steps back. Renewables, yes; fracking, no. - Amanda King, Marrickville\n",
      "PM's help comes at a high price Why does Scott Morrison's plan to evacuate Australians from Wuhan and isolate them on Christmas Island not apply to other passengers entering Australia on planes from China (\" Trapped by deadly virus and red tape \", January 31)?

      "The primary role of government is to ensure the safety of its citizens, and yes, this is done on a user pays system – we all pay taxes for this protection. Yet the government wants to charge Australian citizens to evacuate them from a dangerous situation in Wuhan (“ Australians will need to pay $1000 to be evacuated from Wuhan ”, January 30). In effect, this is charging twice for the one service. An insurance company couldn’t get away with this, so why should the government? - George Rosier, Carlingford\n",
      "I must remember next time I'm rescuing someone to send them a bill. - Moya Gibb Smith, Paddington\n",
      "Some evacuees have expressed their displeasure about being brought to Christmas Island, a faraway place often with negative associations, while others frown upon the $1000 charge, even they know it’s a common practice in assisted departures. Public transport in the city of Wuhan is now basically non-functional, making it almost impossible, for anyone to get to the airport. The government has shared an email on a chat group regarding the assisted departures, and one of the many requirements is that; “You will need to make your own way to the Wuhan airport”. But how? Good luck to all involved. - Jiongjie He, Hillsdale\n",

      "Postscript It was the distractions between the more serious subjects which captured our attention this week: from Aussie greetings (‘‘Ava Goodwin’’ will remain a favourite for a long time), to insects and the embarrassing incorrect use of an apostrophe. Judy Hungerford, of North Curl Curl, elegantly pointed out the errant punctuation: ‘‘Your correspondent may not have any ‘fly’s’, but he has an excess of apostrophes. These pesky critters are obviously resistant to climate change.’’ Yes, they must be. Mark Longstaff, of Port Macquarie, wonders if a trend is emerging, as many contributors from his hometown are members of the Port Macquarie Hastings Bridge Club. ‘‘Is this to become a prerequisite for having letters published in the Herald: letter writers must play bridge?’’\n",
      "Garrett Naumann, of Cammeray, wrote to thank George Fishman ‘‘for stirring up the muddy waters of total consensus’’ on the letters pages of ‘‘sameness’’, where he believes only those who ‘‘toe the progressive line are published’’. Brenton White viewed the same contribution differently: ‘‘At least the SMH prints your letters, George. You wouldn’t get a look in if you were progressive and wrote to the Murdoch press.’’\n",
      "James Moore, of Kogarah, wonders what motivates correspondents. ‘‘I suspect the reasons for the daily letters’ avalanche include outrage at something or someone, writing as an anti-dementia activity or a desire to be noticed by the eight million Herald readers,’’ he writes. ‘‘Whatever the reason, the result is an interesting social history of the period covered.’’ And entertaining, informative pages, thanks to your contributions.\n",

      "THE FACTS: As news spread about the new coronavirus outbreak, social media accounts began promoting the idea that drinking chlorine dioxide or using related products with names like Miracle Mineral Solution — or MMS — would help wipe out the virus. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns against ingesting the bleaching agent. “We understand people are concerned about the spread of the novel coronavirus and we urge people to talk to their health care provider about treatment options, as well as follow advice from other federal agencies about how to prevent the spread of this illness,” the FDA said in a statement to . Social media users began circulating the false claim on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube shortly after the first case of the virus was reported in the U.S. By Friday, virus had infected almost 10,000 people globally in just two months, with more than 200 deaths in China. Chlorine dioxide has been falsely touted by fringe groups online as a “miracle” cure for autism. The FDA has been warning against drinking chlorine dioxide since 2010 after the agency received several reports of consumers drinking products containing the chemical. The agency warns that it can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and symptoms of severe dehydration.\n",

Martial law would transfer power to the military. “This article is not true,” FEMA said in an email sent Tuesday to , adding that they have not advocated for martial law. The false claims about martial law have circulated on Facebook since Jan. 23. “Acting FEMA Director Pete Gaynor on Wednesday offered President Trump a startling solution, Martial Law in the United States, to prevent the spread of a lethal Chinese Coronavirus that infected hundreds and killed at least 17 people in the Communist nation,” the post said.

      "CLAIM: 14 states have no paper ballot record of your vote.\n",
      "THE FACTS: For the 2020 elections only one state, Louisiana, will not keep a paper ballot record of any votes. Eight other states rely on a mixed system, where some counties will keep a paper record of ballots and others will not. Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard posted a video Wednesday on her social media account, in which she misleadingly claimed that 14 states have no paper ballot record of votes cast. Gabbard called it the “greatest threat to our democracy,” warning that it could entirely shape the results of the 2020 election. Her comments, which were not fully accurate, asked people to share the claim on Twitter and Facebook. The information Gabbard provided was outdated and doesn’t provide a full picture of how voters’ ballots will be recorded in the upcoming election. Her campaign did not respond to a request for comment by the AP. States and counties around the country record votes differently. During the 2018 election, there were 14 states where voters might have gone to the polls and cast votes that weren’t backed up on paper. That’s been whittled down to nine states heading into the 2020 election. Currently only one state — Louisiana — keeps no paper trail of votes at all. Counties in eight states — Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas — use a hybrid system that may or may not document the votes on paper, said Warren Stewart, a data analyst at Verified Voting, which tracks the election systems counties across the country use. “Many states have a variety of different systems in different counties,” Stewart said. In those states, some counties do not produce paper receipts of votes. In the case of New Jersey, for example, only one county records votes by paper. In Oklahoma, all counties use a paper ballot record system except for voters with disabilities who might cast a vote on an electronic system. It’s worth noting that there is no federal regulation requiring paper ballot backups. Gabbard introduced legislation last year that would provide states with funding to ensure votes are recorded on paper. Experts have warned that systems without a paper ballot backup could be hacked in the election. Last year, an analysis by the Brennan Center of Justice at New York University’s School of Law found that as many as 12 per cent of voters might cast a ballot without a paper backup in the 2020 election.\n",

Ed Cara 31 Jan 2020 7:17 AM The World Health Organisation on Thursday declared an international public health emergency over the deadly new coronavirus that has hit China hard. The announcement comes as nearly a hundred cases have been spotted in countries outside of China, including the first case of human-to-human transmission in the U.S., also reported on Thursday.

      "Tweet: As cases of the novel coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV continue to increase — topping 7,700 globally on Thursday — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a sixth case in the U.S. Unlike the five previous cases — which were contracted abroad — officials say this infection was spread through person-to-person contact on U.S. soil. Nancy Messonnier, MD, director of the CDC’s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases, said Thursday in a press call that the case centers on a married couple in Chicago. The woman, described as being in her 60s, tested positive for coronavirus after returning from a trip to Wuhan, China in mid-January. As she was being treated in the hospital, her husband, who had been in close contact with her physically, tested positive for the virus as well.\n",
      "Although the news may be alarming, Messonnier stresses that it’s not a reason to panic.\n",
      "“Despite the fact that we are reporting the first instance of person-to-person contact [in the U.S.], it’s important to note that this spread was among two people who were in close contact for an extended period of time,” said Messonnier. “I understand why this may cause people to be worried about how this may affect them. This is a very serious health situation... moving forward we can expect to see more cases.”\n",
      "CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, MD, added that experts had suspected that the novel coronavirus would likely spread via human-to-human contact.\n",
      "“Given what we’ve seen in China and other countries with the novel coronavirus, CDC experts have expected some person-to-person spread in the US,” Redfield said in a statement. “We understand that this may be concerning, but based on what we know now, we still believe the immediate risk to the American public is low.”\n",
      "The CDC confirmed its first U.S. case of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus on Thursday, which involves a husband and wife in Chicago. (Photo by MARK RALSTON/AFP via Getty Images) More Illinois health officials on the press call also provided an update on the two patients in Chicago, saying that the first patient is doing “quite well” and the second patient is “stable.” Messonnier added that, as of now, only those who recently traveled to Wuhan, China — or are in close contact with someone who did — should be concerned. The main symptoms to look out for are fever, cough and shortness of breath. While the CDC said that face masks can be effective, they stressed that the best way to stay safe is to wash your hands.\n",
      "As the CDC works to investigate the first case of human-to-human transmission, the World Health Organization (WHO) is convening for the third time to debate whether the outbreak now constitutes a Global Health Emergency or, as its officially known, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). In a press conference earlier in the week, WHO leadership said that the organization has become increasingly vigilant as the cases in China continue their rapid spread.\n",
      "“These developments, in terms of the evolution of the outbreak and further development of transmission, these are of grave concern and has spurred countries into action,” Mike Ryan, PhD, executive director of the WHO’s health emergency program, said , according to CNBC.\n",
      "But in the U.S., officials continue to assert that the risk to Americans overall remains low. \"This is a very fast-moving and constantly changing situation,\" Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar told reporters Tuesday. \"But at this point, Americans should not worry for their own safety.\"\n",

      "The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency on Thursday as the coronavirus outbreak spread well beyond China, where it emerged last month.\n",
      "The move reversed the organization’s decision just a week ago to hold off such a declaration . Since then, there have been thousands of new cases in China and clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in several other countries , including the United States.\n",
      "All of which warranted a reconsideration by the W.H.O.’s emergency committee, officials said.\n",
      "The declaration “is not a vote of no-confidence in China,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director-general. “On the contrary, the W.H.O. continues to have confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak.”\n",
      "The declaration comes now, he said, because of fears that the coronavirus may reach countries with weak health care systems, where it could run amok, potentially infecting millions of people and killing thousands.\n",

      "Nonetheless, emergency declarations signal that the world’s top health advisory body thinks the situation is grave. Many scientific experts welcomed the decision.\n",
      "The public health emergency “allows them to further lean into the role of global leadership for governments and the private sector,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a veteran of several global health emergencies.\n",
      "The first goal, he said, should be to understand more about how the virus is spreading — whether mostly in hospitals and clinics, what ages and sexes or professions are most affected, how sick they become and what risk factors are dangerous.\n",
      "But Amir Attaran, a professor of law and epidemiology at the University of Ottawa and a frequent W.H.O. critic, called the declaration “inexcusably late.” The committee’s reasoning that it lacked enough scientific evidence to declare an emergency last week was “balderdash,” he added.\n",
      "“W.H.O. is paralyzed for the same political reasons that ruined its scientific judgment in SARS, Ebola and Zika,” he said. “Borders are closed, aircraft grounded and ships anchored as W.H.O. mutely dithers over whether or not to declare an emergency.”\n",

      "It is understood that they travelled to the UK from China in recent days, had been staying at a hotel in Yorkshire, and are now undergoing treatment at the Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary.\n",
      "An outbreak investigation team has been formed to trace anyone who has been in contact with the pair to prevent onward transmission.\n",

      "Move to support those who lose source of income due to coronavirus outbreak\n",
      "China will extend repayment plans for personal mortgage loans and credit cards of people who temporarily lose their sources of income due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, said the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.\n",
      "In a recently issued notice, the country's top banking and insurance regulator demanded financial institutions adjust the above-mentioned repayment plans for those people flexibly and extend their loan terms reasonably.\n",
      "The China Banking Association, a self-regulatory organization of the Chinese banking sector, also discouraged its members from blacklisting people who temporarily lose their sources of income and are therefore likely to default on their personal loans or credit cards.\n",
      "Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with Centaline Property Agency, said it is still too early to estimate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the real estate industry.\n",
      "\"The level of impact depends on how long the virus outbreak lasts. Generally speaking, the industry outlook is not positive. Investors will become far less willing to invest in the real estate industry unless the outbreak has eased off,\" Zhang said.\n",
      "Analysts are still waiting for details on which people will be defined as those who have temporarily lost their sources of income due to the coronavirus outbreak and how banks will adjust personal mortgage loan repayment plans for these people.\n",
      "According to the notice recently issued by the regulator, banks are not allowed to withdraw or reduce their loans to the industries that may be hugely affected by the novel coronavirus outbreak, such as the retail, wholesale, catering, logistics, culture and tourism industries, as well as the companies that have great potential but suffer temporary difficulties.\n",
      "The regulator encouraged banks to help relevant companies overcome the negative impact of the epidemic by appropriately lowering lending rates, improving loan renewal policies, and increasing the offering of medium-and long-term loans, as well as unsecured loans based on the companies' credit.\n",
      "As of Tuesday noon, more than 20 banks had donated over 700 million yuan (US$101 million) in support of the battle against the coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.\n",
      "Many banks launched policies to better meet the financing needs of businesses that are engaged in the research, production and distribution of medicines, and protective and medical equipment for combating the virus. The policies include offering loans at lower rates and waiving fees.\n",
      "China Merchants Bank Co Ltd, a joint-stock commercial lender headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, took the lead among banks in terms of the amount of money donated, which was 200 million yuan. As of Tuesday, its Wuhan branch had issued loans totaling 2.94 billion yuan to medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies involved in the prevention and control of the coronavirus.\n",
      "Financial institutions in the insurance sector also contributed to the epidemic prevention in their own ways.\n",
      "The Insurance Association of China called on insurers to settle claims first of clients infected with the coronavirus and allow them to hand in all the documents required later, in addition to urging insurers to moderately extend the scope of their responsibilities in this regard.\n",
      "The association also encouraged insurers to accelerate the development of insurance products and services targeting doctors, nurses, disease control personnel and their families, to provide financial coverage for disability and death caused by virus infection and other accidents during the process of disease control and prevention.\n",
      "China Life Insurance Co Ltd, a leading life insurer in China with extensive geographic coverage, launched a 24/7 online channel to settle claims of the clients who caught pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. It had settled four such claims by the end of Wednesday.\n",
      "The company also donated life insurance policies to 180,000 doctors and nurses combating the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. The sum insured is 500,000 yuan per person.\n",

      "Speaking in the House of Assembly today [Jan 31], Minister Wilson said, “I rise today to share the most up to date information and guidance for residents regarding the coronavirus. First of all, I can assure you that as of this morning, there are no cases in Bermuda or known suspect cases.\n",
      "“The Ministry of Health’s Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit is in constant liaison with international public health authorities including, the World Health Organization, and in step with them when the coronavirus outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern Travel last night.\n",
      "“Accordingly, the Ministry of Health’s Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit [ESU] are treating the local threat level as ‘Elevated’ and are in a state of heightened preparedness for a Public Health Emergency.\n",
      "“This means that the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit is working closely with all relevant stakeholders from different disciplines and sectors of society to plan and prepare for the possible introduction of the Coronavirus.\n",
      "“This work includes very close collaboration with airport Customs, Immigration, and Skyport to enhance screening of arriving travellers and direct those with a travel history risk for further monitoring and assessment.”\n",
      "On a related note, the police took to social media to dispel a rumour, saying that there “are aware of messages circulating on social media suggesting that a passenger on a plane diverted to Bermuda last night has Coronavirus.\n",
      "“This is untrue. The flight diversion Thursday evening for an ill passenger had nothing to do with the Coronavirus outbreak,” the police tweeted.\n",
      "The Minister’s full statement follows below:\n",
      "Mr Speaker and Honourable Members,\n",
      "I rise today to share the most up to date information and guidance for residents regarding the coronavirus.\n",
      "First of all, I can assure you that as of this morning, there are no cases in Bermuda or known suspect cases. The Ministry of Health’s Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit is in constant liaison with international public health authorities including, the World Health Organization, and in step with them when the coronavirus outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern Travel last night.\n",
      "Travel advice revisions are being considered accordingly and the Ministry of Health will continue to keep the public abreast of developments. Any situation posing a risk to the safety of the public will be communicated through official Ministry of Health channels.\n",
      "Mr Speaker, the World Health Organization [WHO] has stated that in China the risk of the coronavirus is very high, and the risk to all other countries is consequently also high, due to extensive global travel. We are a hyper-connected world now-a-days which raises the likelihood and speed at which communicable diseases can spread between countries.\n",
      "Accordingly, the Ministry of Health’s Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit [ESU] are treating the local threat level as “Elevated” and are in a state of heightened preparedness for a Public Health Emergency.\n",
      "This means that the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit is working closely with all relevant stakeholders from different disciplines and sectors of society to plan and prepare for the possible introduction of the Coronavirus.\n",
      "Mr Speaker, This work includes very close collaboration with airport Customs, Immigration, and Skyport to enhance screening of arriving travellers and direct those with a travel history risk for further monitoring and assessment.\n",
      "That is, arriving travellers will be asked about their travel in the past 21 days and about current illness. Those who have spent time in jurisdictions considered at very high risk will be given health instructions for follow up and advice on self-monitoring for illness for 14 days.\n",
      "Mr Speaker, I reiterate for the benefit of the listening public: there are no cases or known suspect cases currently in Bermuda [as of this morning]. To be classified as a “suspect case”, the WHO has defined specific criteria that an individual must have. This includes a relevant travel history risk or contact risk.\n",
      "Our medical teams who liaise directly with international public health agencies advise us that the 2019-nCoV, or novel coronavirus, has not been fully characterized in terms of its origin, mode of transmission and how it makes individuals ill. Much of this information is just being gathered in clinical research settings worldwide.\n",
      "What we do know is that it appears to be transmitted from infected animals or humans to other humans; takes between 2-10 days to incubate before making an infected individual ill with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. A high percentage of those infected become seriously ill and a smaller percentage die from the infection. To date, most fatalities have been in individuals with other serious medical conditions [co-morbidities] such as heart, lung, kidney or liver disease.\n",
      "The situation is extremely dynamic, changing every few hours as information is gathered and shared by public health authorities. Therefore, information available to the public is accumulating rapidly and the public must stay abreast of changes and developments through trusted sources only. The World Health Organization website and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are trusted sources of up to the moment global information.\n",
      "Mr Speaker, It is critical for the public to turn their attention only to established, trusted sources of health information, particularly in today’s environment which is rife with fake news via social media. The public is urged to rely on credible information sources, in particular: the Bermuda Government website, its Facebook, Twitter, Instagram feeds, and the Tree Frog app are the official sources of Ministry of Health information.\n",
      "These will be updated continuously as information is received and confirmed. If a case of coronavirus is confirmed in Bermuda, contact tracing will begin immediately and relevant individuals will be contacted by Ministry of Health staff. Any situation posing a risk to the safety of the general public will be communicated through official Ministry of Health channels.\n",
      "The public is urged to follow the advice of public health authorities: If you have not had a seasonal influenza shot get one from your healthcare provider or the Department of Health Clinic Avoid visits to the Emergency Department unless there is an emergency. If you are ill with an infectious disease, stay home from work and social gatherings until you no longer have a fever or cough, or vomiting and diarrhoea. Always cover coughs with tissues or sleeves and wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. Restrict non-essential travel to areas known to be affected with coronavirus. These areas are updated on the WHO website.\n",
      "Keeping Bermuda safe will need cooperation from the whole community. Bermuda pulls together in the face of emergencies, Mr Speaker. In this case we must also pull together to prevent it. Related Stories\n",

If we do see price fall back below the 100-day MA, then the near-term bias will turn more bearish once again.

The daily chart: As the market continues to grapple with coronavirus fears, the battle in USD/JPY will continue until one of the key technical levels firmly give way. For now, buyers have managed to muster some momentum in search of an upside break but there doesn't seem to be any follow through move.

      "Virtually all of the world’s iPhones are made in China, primarily by Foxconn’s Hon Hai Precision Industry at its so-called iPhone City in Zhengzhou and by Pegatron Corp. at an assembly site near Shanghai. Each of those locations is more than 300 miles away from Wuhan in central China, the epicenter of the viral outbreak, but that distance doesn’t immunize them from its effects.\n",
      "Workers line up for roll call at a Pegatron factory in Shanghai in 2016. Qilai Shen/Bloomberg\n",
      "“I can’t imagine a scenario where the supply chain isn’t disrupted,” said veteran industry analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “If there’s one major hiccup in the raw materials, fabrication, assembly, test, and shipping, it will be a disruption.”\n",
      "Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook tweeted over the weekend that Apple “will be donating to groups on the ground helping support all of those affected” by the virus.\n",
      "Apple has been increasing production to meet higher-than-anticipated iPhone demand, Bloomberg News reported last week. The company typically launches its new high-end iPhones around September, so the virus is unlikely to have meaningful impact on those plans. However, the company is also preparing to begin mass production of a new low-cost iPhone in February, which is more at risk.\n",
      "Apple has roughly 10,000 direct employees in China, across its retail and corporate entities. Its supply chain also has a few million workers manufacturing products like the iPad, iPhone and Apple Watch. Many of those employees have been home the past few days for the holiday, and the company hasn’t said if it is asking them to stay home for longer to prevent the virus spreading. Chinese authorities have imposed severe travel restrictions and taken the drastic step of quarantining the entire city of Wuhan, a population of more than 11 million.\n",
      "“Supply chain disruption is a worry if employees across Foxconn and other component manufacturing hubs in China are restricted,” said analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities Inc. “If the China outbreak becomes more spread it could negatively impact the supply chain which would be a major investor worry.”\n",
      "Shoppers browse the Upper West Side Apple store in New York in 2014. Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\n",

It declined to comment on production in specific locations but said, “We can confirm that we have measures in place to ensure that we can continue to meet all global manufacturing obligations.”\n",
      "Confirmed cases of the coronavirus are rising in Henan province — home to Zhengzhou facility — which may lead Hon Hai or the government to close factories to prevent further contamination, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Kanterman wrote. The province accounted for a quarter of China’s smartphone exports last year, while China’s exports make up 27% of global smartphone sales, he said, citing government and IDC data. Foxconn is estimated to account for more than 60% of Henan’s total trade.\n",
      "The Cupertino, Calif.-based company prepares for extreme scenarios such as the coronavirus by mandating that major components be dual-sourced — both in terms of vendors and geography — and a major immediate impact to its production plans is unlikely for now, according to a person familiar with its operations. Even so, the vast majority of its assembly work is done in China, and so a shortage of workers for assembly lines will have a direct impact on shipment numbers.\n",
      "Apple put the redundancy policy in place after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan and led to component constraints for the iPad 2 that the company launched that year.\n",
      "While Apple doesn’t have any stores in Wuhan, it does have dozens of retail locations across the Chinese mainland. The company hasn’t announced any closures yet, however it has shortened the opening hours of several stores in the country through Feb. 7, according to a review of its retail website. That shift could be due to the Chinese government extending the lunar holiday as a means to control the virus.\n",
      "Along with its local workforce, Apple also relies on many of its U.S. staff going back and forth across the Pacific Ocean, with United Airlines Inc. last year revealing the company was spending $35 million per year flying employees between San Francisco and Shanghai alone. That included 50 daily business-class seats, according to the airline.

      "Tweet: Both Singapore and Thailand are expected to take bigger hits from the Wuhan virus outbreak than their regional neighbours, in part because of the expected impact on tourism-related parts of the economy. ― TODAY file pic SINGAPORE, Jan 31 — The economies of Singapore and Thailand are set to be the hardest hit in the region by the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak as they are more dependent on China's trade and tourism than their neighbours, a new report has found.\n",
      "The report, by a team of analysts from financial services firm Maybank Kim Eng, cites several factors as to why the outbreak could be more economically damaging than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003.\n",
      "One factor is that China’s economy is larger now compared to in 2003. Another factor is that the country is more connected to the wider world now.\n",
      "But the report also points to factors that could soften the economic impact, such as China’s faster and more transparent response to the health crisis.\n",
      "Authored by Dr Chua Hak Bin, Lee Ju Ye and Linda Liu, the report released yesterday states that the Wuhan virus outbreak has cast a shadow on the potential recovery of the manufacturing sector.\n",
      "Malaysia and Vietnam will be negatively impacted by the outbreak, though not as much as Singapore and Thailand, while Indonesia and the Philippines will be the least affected among the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) as they are domestic-oriented economies, the analysts said.\n",
      "The outbreak that began in Wuhan, the capital of China's central province of Hubei, has killed 170 people in the country and infected more than 7,800 globally, most of them in China.\n",
      "It has also spread to 19 other places, with Singapore reporting 10 imported cases.\n",
      "Here are the number of Wuhan virus cases in other Asean countries:\n",
      "― Thailand: 14\n",
      "― Malaysia: 7\n",
      "― Vietnam: 2\n",
      "― Cambodia: 1\n",
      "Impact on Asean\n",
      "The analysts expect Singapore’s economy to take a hit, like how it did during SARS, with tourism-related sectors the worst affected.\n",
      "The virus causing this recent outbreak belongs to the same family of viruses as SARS, which also spread from China to the rest of the world. More than 8,000 were infected and 774 killed globally.\n",
      "Restaurants, retail trade and the land transport sectors in Singapore may suffer the greatest impact from the Wuhan virus, the report said.\n",
      "While consumer sales are also expected to go down, the analysts believe that the eventual blow will not be too painful given that e-commerce transactions now make up 6 per cent of all retail sales.\n",
      "Using SARS as a reference point, Selena Ling, an economist at OCBC, said in a research note on Thursday that Singapore’s economic growth could potentially go down by 0.5 to 1 percentage points if the current outbreak lasts for more than three to six months.\n",
      "The Maybank Kim Eng analysts also expect Thailand to be negatively impacted, given that it is the largest tourist destination for mainland Chinese travellers, outside of Hong Kong and Macau.\n",
      "Tourism authorities in Thailand expect Chinese tourists to fall to nine million in 2020, down from 11 million in 2019, due to the ban on group tours going out of China. This would translate to a loss of about US$1.7 billion (RM6.94 billion), or 0.3 per cent of its economic output.\n",
      "Malaysia will also be affected by the decline in Chinese tourists, especially its casino sector. But some other parts of the economy, such as its medical gloves production sector, have benefited from the Wuhan virus outbreak.\n",
      "Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said Asean countries that depend on Chinese tourism would be most impacted.\n",
      "Singapore Budget measures\n",
      "The analysts expect that Budget 2020, to be delivered on February 18, will include measures to help businesses hardest hit by the Wuhan virus, specifically the tourism and consumer-related sectors.\n",
      "The report states that the government may lower foreign worker levies for the hotel and food and beverage industries.\n",
      "Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Monday that the Government is working with the labour movement and various trade associations to develop support measures, but stopped short of confirming that these will be introduced in the Budget.\n",
      "Manpower Minister Josephine Teo reiterated this yesterday, during a briefing ahead of the advance release of the labour market report for the fourth quarter.\n",
      "Difference between the Wuhan virus and SARS\n",
      "Teo said that the current situation with the Wuhan virus is “significantly different” from when Singapore was coping with SARS.\n",
      "There were more unknowns when SARS first spread, and there was a fairly long period when authorities were “grappling in the dark”.\n",
      "“Today it is all about organising the response, today very clearly we know it is about containment.”\n",
      "Mrs Teo also said that Singapore’s economy is more diversified than in 2003, with the tourism and hospitality sector accounting for a smaller share of the economy.\n",
      "However, she added that Singapore should still “expect unknown unknowns”.\n",
      "The Maybank Kim Eng analysts highlighted other differences between SARS and the Wuhan virus.\n",
      "For one thing, they expect the number of patients infected with the Wuhan virus to exceed SARS, because the former is more infectious.\n",
      "However, the number of deaths will likely be lower than the 774 during SARS due to China’s early warnings and rapid containment measures and the fact that early signs indicate that the fatality rate for the Wuhan virus is 3 per cent, against 10 per cent for SARS.\n",
      "Why the Wuhan virus outbreak could be less damaging than SARS\n",
      "Faster and more transparent policy response\n",
      "China has implemented a faster and more aggressive policy response to contain the Wuhan virus outbreak.\n",
      "SARS was allowed to spread for longer as China only officially went public to the World Health Organization in February 2003, several months after the virus emerged in late 2002.\n",
      "However, this time China was more transparent and took proactive measures to contain the Wuhan virus, such as putting Wuhan and several other cities around it in lockdown.\n",
      "Other governments have also responded quickly, said the analysts, with several countries imposing travel restrictions and leave of absence for some people coming back from China.\n",
      "More efficient communication among healthcare experts\n",
      "Public health experts from China are sharing genetic information of the Wuhan virus to researchers globally.\n",
      "It took four months for the SARS genome to be published.\n",
      "Why the Wuhan virus outbreak could be worse than SARS\n",
      "While the aggressive measures could shorten the duration of the virus outbreak, the analysts said that it could sacrifice economic growth in the short term.\n",
      "Economic growth was hurt for one quarter during SARS but it quickly recovered in the subsequent quarter for Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. The rest of Asean suffered only a minimal impact.\n",
      "The impact was mainly felt in the tourism and transport sectors, as visitor arrivals plunged across the whole of Asean.\n",
      "There is, however, a risk of a larger negative impact this time because:\n",
      "― China is now a far larger economy taking a bigger share of regional exports\n",
      "― China is more connected to the world\n",
      "― Chinese tourist arrivals have been a major growth engine for Asean\n",
      "The size of China’s economy\n",
      "China’s share of global economic output grew to 18.6 per cent in 2018, from just 9 per cent in 2003. This means that Asean economies are now a lot more dependent on China’s growth.\n",
      "China’s market share of Asean exports is at 14 per cent in 2018, compared to 6.5 per cent in 2003.\n",
      "China’s connectivity with the world\n",
      "The risk of the virus spreading has increased compared with 2003 along with China’s greater global connectivity.\n",
      "International air passenger traffic from China has more than quadrupled from 15 million in 2008 to 64 million in 2018.\n",
      "Chinese tourists\n",
      "Chinese tourists in Asean have grown almost 10 times, from 2.9 million in 2003 to 27 million in 2018.\n",
      "Tourism receipts from Chinese travellers have been growing in importance as a contributor to Asean economies.\n",

      "Tweet: Stocks Finishing on Poor Note, while the Dollar and Bonds Firm Stocks Finishing on Poor Note, while the Dollar and Bonds Firm January 31, 2020 $USD , Brexit , China , EMU , Japan , WHO Overview: It was as if the World Health Organization's recognition of that the new coronavirus is an international health emergency was the catalyst that the markets needed. US equities recovered smartly and managed to close higher on the session. However, the coattails were short, and follow-through buying of US shares fizzled. In the Asia Pacific, Japan, Taiwan, and Australian equities firmed, while disappointing data weighed on European equities. The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is off about 2.5% this week, its largest decline in October. The S&P 500 is trading about 0.5% lower. Benchmark 10-year yields are edging lower. The US 10-year is holding below 1.60% for the second consecutive session, and the 30-year is just above 2.0%. The dollar is mostly higher, with sterling resisting the tug as the UK is prepared to leave the EU tonight. Emerging market currencies are also heavy, as risk is mostly shunned. The JP Morgan Emerging Market Currency Index is off 1.25% this week, the most since last August. Gold is firm, and near $1580 is up a little more than 0.5% on the week. Oil is steady to firmer today, but March WTI is down 3.25% this week, its fourth consecutive weekly loss, and is holding just above key support near $52 Asia Pacific The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency, which is a cue for more national and international action and resources. At the same time, it opined that restrictions on travel and trade were unnecessary now, though it does not clear than any actual curbs have been rescinded. WHO officials also praised China national leaders for their aggressive response, which included building a new hospital in 10 days. However, it appears local officials may have been slow to respond initially. China's official PMI did not show the stress of the coronavirus but did indicate the manufacturing sector was vulnerable before the health crisis. The January manufacturing PMI slipped to 50.0 from 50.2. The non-manufacturing sector performed better, rising to 54.1 from 53.5. The composite eased to 53.0 from 53.4. The officially extended Lunar New Year holiday ends February 2, but provinces and cities that account for around 2/3 of the country's GDP will remain shut for about another week. Japan's retail sales disappointed, but the industrial output jumped 1.3%, its first increase in three months. December retail sales rose by 0.2% compared with expectations for nearer a 1% gain. Recall that retail sales plummeted in October (sales tax increase and typhoon) and surged 4.5% in November. The rise in industrial production featured a strong rise in equipment that produces flat panel displays. Nevertheless, industrial output fell about 4% in Q4 and will drag GDP lower. Japanese unemployment was steady ay 2.2%, a 27-year low. Separately, South Korea also reported better than expected industrial output figures for December. The 3.5% jump was the most in three years. Expectations for less than a 1% increase. The data is consistent with an uptick in the region before the coronavirus struck. The dollar rose to almost JPY109.15 before falling out of favor and slipped back to session lows below JPY108.90. However, the intraday technicals suggest the downside may be limited ahead of the weekend. At the same time, there are about $1.2 bln in options struck between JPY109.00 and JPY109.20 that expire today that suggest progress to the upside will be slow in any event. The dollar has closed lower against the yen in eight of the past ten sessions. The target of the head and shoulders top in the Australian dollar projects toward $0.6670, and with today's loss, it is has approached $0.6680. The intraday and daily technical indicators are stretched, and it is through its lower Bollinger Band (two standard deviations below the 20-day moving average) seen a little below $0.6710. The US dollar edged up against the offshore yuan (CNH) and has risen by almost 0.9% against it since the mainland market closed. A commensurate move against the onshore yuan puts the dollar close to CNY7.0. Europe At his last meeting as BOE Governor, Carney pulled the proverbial rabbit out of a hat. Many observers had counted five officials that had sounded particularly dovish lately, including Carney himself. The close call that investors collective discounted was not so close after all. It was the same 7-2 vote as the previous two meetings. The central bank cut its growth forecasts for this year and next by 0.4% to 0.8% and 1.4% respectively. Nevertheless, the message the market took away was one of a hawkish hold. The implied yield of the December short-sterling interest rate futures rose 5.5 bp to a two-week high, and sterling snapped a five-day losing streak. It successfully retested the week's low near $1.2975 and rebounded to briefly trade above $1.3100. It is pushing above yesterday's highs today. News from the euro-area disappointed. France and Italy unexpectedly reported their economies contracted in Q4 19 (0.1% and 0.3%, respectively). Spain surprised on the upside with 0.5% growth. These national figures translate into Q4 EMU growth of 0.1% rather than the 0.2% economists expected after a 0.3% expansion in Q3. Compounding the challenge, consumer prices fell 1% in December, while the year-over-year rate edged up to 1.4% from 1.3%, while the core rate eased to 1.1% from 1.3%. The UK is set to leave the EU later today after a turbulent 47 years of membership. The British pound is firm, having reached a six-day high near $1.3140 in early European turnover. The intraday charts warn it may be difficult to extend the gains much more ahead of the weekend. Also, there is a GBP240 mln option at $1.3150 that will be cut today. Sterling finished last week just below $1.3100. The euro has been confined to about a fifth of a cent range today. Yesterday's $1.1040 was the high for the week, and it will be challenged today. There is an option for roughly 975 mln euros struck there. Additional resistance is seen in the $1.1050-$1.1065 band. America Today's report of December personal income and consumption data do not really offer new information. It was already embedded in yesterday's estimate of Q4 GDP. The 2.1% annualized clip matched the Q3 pace, but the composition was different, though private non-residential investment fell (1.5%) for the third consecutive quarterly decline. Consumption was soft, rising at 1.8% down from 3.2% and disappointing forecasts for a 2% increase. Residential investment was the strongest in a couple of years, as we have seen with housing starts. Trade, as in net exports, contributed 1.48 percentage points to Q4 GDP, the most in a decade. Imports fell sharply, and this probably is not sustainable. Inventories shaved growth by nearly 1.1 percentage points. With the GM strike, auto part imports were impacted, cut inventories, and output (weaker auto output took about 0.8 percentage points off Q4 GDP). The underlying signal comes from the private final domestic sales, which excludes the government, trade, and inventories. It rose 1.4% at an annualized pace in Q4, the slowest in four years. Given Boeing's output cuts in Q1 20 and the disruption caused by the virus, officials will likely look past Q1 data. Canada reports November GDP figures today. They are too dated to have much impact. Economists expect the economy was flat after contracting by 0.1% in October. The year-over-year rate may have ticked up to 1.4% from 1.2%. Mexico reported Q4 19 GDP was flat yesterday, which was slightly better than fared. The year-over-year pace remained at 0.3% as it was in Q3. The central bank meets on February 13 and is expected to cut the 7.25% overnight target rate. Separately, the ink on the US signing of the USMCA hardly even dry, and Mexico warns that it will retaliate if the US carries through with threats of tariffs on Mexico's seasonal produce exports. The US dollar is rising against the Canadian dollar for the fourth session this week. It reached CAD1.3245, the highest level since December 10 and pushed above the 200-day moving average (~CAD1.3230) for the first time December 3. While we had expected the US dollar to recover after trading below CAD1.30 earlier this month, the technical indicators are now stretched. The risk-reward is shifting and may not favor new US dollar longs. The US dollar has edged up against the Mexican peso for the second consecutive week, over which time it has not even risen 1%. When risk appetites return, the peso is likely to be a major beneficiary.

The number of cases spiked more than tenfold in a week, including the highest death toll in a 24-hour period reported Friday.\n",
      "The State Department's travel advisory told Americans currently in China to consider departing using commercial means, and requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel \"in light of the novel coronavirus.”\n",
      "China counted 9,692 confirmed cases with a death toll of 213, including 43 new fatalities. The vast majority of the cases have been in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. No deaths have been reported outside China.\n",
      "Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it will send charter flights to bring home residents of Hubei from overseas.\n",
      "The one-sentence statement gave few details, but said those from Hubei and especially Wuhan would be sent directly back to Wuhan as soon as possible in light of the “practical difficulties\" they were encountering.\n",
      "China has placed more than 50 million people in the region under virtual quarantine, while foreign countries have cut back severely on travel to the country and quarantined those who recently passed through Wuhan. The virus is believed to have a two-week incubation period, during which those infected can pass on the illness even if they show no symptoms such as fever and cough.\n",
      "In the seven days ending at midnight Thursday, the National Health Commission reported 596 cases have been \"cured and discharged from hospital.\"\n",
      "The U.N. health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a co-ordinated international response.\n",
      "China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.\n",
      "Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and have noted with concern instances in other countries — including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea and Vietnam — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.\n",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said it was authorizing the departure of family members and all non-emergency U.S. government employees from Beijing and the consulates in the cities of Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang. Staff from the Wuhan consulate departed earlier this week.\n",
      "The decision was made “out of an abundance of caution related to logistical disruptions stemming from restricted transportation and availability of appropriate health care related to the novel coronavirus,\" the embassy said.\n",

      "There have been cases reported of the infectious virus spreading to others in a household or workplace in China and elsewhere. The case in South Korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier.\n",
      "Human-to-human spread of the virus outside China has also occurred in Germany, Japan, Canada and Vietnam, and was a major reason the World Health Organization has convened its committee of experts Thursday to assess whether the outbreak warrants being declared a global emergency. The committee last week had advised the U.N. health agency it was too early to make that pronouncement.\n",

      "Transport ministry spokesman Wu Chungeng outlined a series of rigorous temperature checks and other “severe measures” to detect possibly infectious passengers. Transport restrictions such as those isolating Wuhan and suspending inter-provincial bus services would remain in place, Wu said.\n",
      "“It’s definitely very challenging, but we’re confident we can exert effective control,” Wu told reporters at the briefing.\n",
      "The WHO emergencies chief, Michael Ryan, speaking in Geneva Wednesday after returning from Beijing, said China was taking “extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge” posed by the outbreak.\n",
      "To date, about 99% of the cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at 2%, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it’s likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed.\n",
      "In comparison, the SARS virus killed about 10% of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS.\n",
      "Chinese authorities have demanded anyone who traveled from or through Wuhan report to health authorities and self-quarantine themselves for 14 days, the maximum incubation period during which patients can be infectious even if they don’t show symptoms.\n",
      "China has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumors — a reflection of the one-party Communist state’s determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media.\n",

      "Tweet: One of the most common and beloved tropes on a reality show comes when a contestant announces, often with a melodramatic flourish, that they are “ not here to make friends .” It’s an ingenious and endlessly useful phrase — one that is both recognizably true (the contestant’s only real goal is victory) and terrifying in its implications. A person who is not here to make friends is signaling that they might do anything to win. They lie, they cheat, they throw a glass of pinot grigio in your face — whatever it takes to become become the bachelorette.\n",
      "I thought of the phrase on Wednesday while reading Mark Zuckerberg’s comments, during Facebook’s quarterly earnings call, about his new goal for the 2020s. He said (emphasis mine):\n",
      "“We’re also focused on communicating more clearly what we stand for. One critique of our approach for much of the last decade was that, because we wanted to be liked, we didn’t always communicate our views as clearly because we were worried about offending people. So this led to some positive but shallow sentiments towards us and towards the company. And my goal for this next decade isn’t to be liked, but to be understood , because in order to be trusted, people need to know what you stand for.”\n",
      "What views did Facebook express unclearly because it didn’t want to offend us? Zuckerberg didn’t say, but I have my guesses. That people like personalized ads more than they value their data privacy, maybe. Or that it’s more important to preserve a wide arena for free speech than it is to prevent certain kinds of harms. These are views that would offend many if a Facebook executive said them out loud, and yet also the company acts as if it holds these things to be true. A fun question to ponder after reading these remarks is on which subjects Zuckerberg will now be willing to offend us.\n",
      "Here’s another: What does it mean that a CEO would rather be understood than be liked? In an environment where Facebook has more power than ever — its quarterly earnings were stellar as usual , even if growth has slowed a bit from its peak — the answer feels important.\n",
      "Being liked is, of course, a basic human need, even for CEOs. Like any other group of people, the tech executives I’ve known vary in how deeply they seem to need affirmation. But starting a successful company has historically been a pretty good way to get the world to like you. You create jobs, you grow the economy, you earn wealth for yourself and your family, and people begin to hang on your every word.\n",
      "Success also breeds backlash, though. The company’s work typically has externalities that the CEO has not accounted for, or has begun to address only belatedly. As the second-order consequences of your success compound, the world begins to doubt your motives. They excoriate you in the press, they haul you before Congress, and they threaten to smash your company into little pieces.\n",
      "It is in such a world, I think, that a CEO might say that, going forward, his goal is no longer to be liked but to be understood. Not because he doesn’t want to be liked — but because the people who like him like him already, the people who don’t are not likely to change their minds, and really the whole matter of reputation seems largely beyond his control.\n",
      "Being understood, though — that at least seems possible. So what does Zuckerberg hope that we understand about Facebook? Here’s Jeff Horwitz in the Wall Street Journal :\n",
      "Mr. Zuckerberg said he would defend users’ rights to associate with groups of their choosing, the societal value of targeted advertising and the model of providing free communications services — all of which he said are under attack. He also defended the company’s plans to further integrate its products, which critics have said are meant to make it harder for antitrust regulators to take action against the company.\n",
      "Presumably, what Zuckerberg really wants here isn’t simply to be understood, but to have more people agree with him. It seems like a stretch to suggest that the growing number of people opposed to highly targeted advertising don’t understand its value. Rather, they believe it does more harm than good . It’s the same with the “right to associate.” On one hand, I suspect most Americans do believe in a right to free assembly. But do they believe Facebook ought to provide a platform for anti-vaccine zealots to congregate and hijack Facebook’s viral machinery to recruit new followers? Either way, the issue doesn’t strike me as one of understanding , per se.\n",
      "“In order to be trusted, people need to know what you stand for,” Zuckerberg said later in his remarks. That’s true enough, but it’s also the case that many people don’t trust Facebook even when they know what the company stands for. In fact, it’s some of the qualities about Facebook that are best understood — its continuous rapid growth, expansive data collection, and feeds ranked by how likely they are to generate an emotional charge — that most upset the company’s critics.\n",
      "If Facebook is to turn public opinion around, it has to do more than remind us that it provides a suite of free communication tools. It has to make the case that those tools have a net-positive effect on the world — and are worth the high cost it takes to deliver them. It has to address the viewpoint of some current and former employees that the product is better compared to sugar or nicotine than to a Millsian marketplace of ideas.\n",
      "And it can’t make that case through argument alone. The products, and their user base, will have to make the case for themselves. They will have to persuade. They will have to make friends.\n",

      "Tweet: President Donald Trump regaled a friendly New Jersey campaign crowd with his thoughts about with his thoughts about impeachment, the economy, the border wall, local politics and much more.\n",
      "But he was conspicuously quiet about one big issue keeping much of the globe on pins and needles: the spread of a deadly new type of coronavirus.\n",
      "A self-described germaphobe, Trump has had little to say in public about the virus that so far has killed more than 170 people in China, sickened thousands more there and led to a handful of confirmed cases in the U.S., including the first U.S. case of person-to-person transmission reported Thursday by health officials.\n",
      "And he speaks in broad terms when he does talk about it.\n",
      "\"We're very much involved with them, right now, on the virus that's going around,\" Trump said of China before signing a trade deal at the White House on Wednesday. He said he had discussed the situation with Chinese President Xi Jinping and added, \"We're working very closely with China.\"\n",
      "Aides and confidants say Trump's careful approach is part of a political strategy crafted to avoid upsetting the stock market or angering China by calling too much attention to the virus or blaming Beijing for not managing the situation better, according to a White House official and a Republican close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n",
      "Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted photos from a briefing on the virus he attended with administration officials in the Situation Room, writing that \"we have the best experts anywhere in the world and they are on top of it 24/7!\"\n",
      "In keeping with the low-profile approach, the White House announced by email Wednesday night that the meeting included members of a task force that will lead the U.S. response to the new virus. The 12-person team is chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and co-ordinated through the National Security Council.\n",
      "The president's comments contrast sharply with the fierce criticism he lobbed at his predecessor, President Barack Obama, during the 2014-15 Ebola crisis, which left more than 11,000 dead in three West African nations.\n",
      "At the time, Trump ripped into Obama as a \"dope\" and \"incompetent\" and called for a travel ban on visitors from Ebola-infected countries. Trump also advocated preventing infected American health care workers from coming home for treatment.\n",
      "Obama faced some criticism from public health officials for being slow to address the Ebola crisis initially, but also received plaudits for eventually attacking it with vigour. He nudged Congress to make a $5.4 billion emergency appropriation to aid the fight and sent 3,000 U.S. troops to West Africa to help with the international response.\n",
      "Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said he's taken a measure of comfort in the fact that Trump, so far, hasn't overreacted and has resisted \"fanning the flames\" as he did with his rhetoric during the Ebola crisis. That leaves room, Gostin said, for public health professionals to take the lead.\n",
      "\"As long as that continues and as long as there isn't political interference or mass quarantines in the U.S. or outright travel bans, I will feel comfortable with how the White House is handling it,\" Gostin said. He added that he'd like to see Trump ask Congress for a $1 billion emergency appropriation to help agencies battling to contain the virus.\n",
      "Trump is well aware the virus outbreak in China could create a wild card for the U.S. economy during an election year. And he has long prioritized the U.S. economic relationship with China, especially during trade negotiations, and similarly largely held his tongue during widespread protests in Hong Kong. He also takes enormous pride in the personal relationship he's developed with Xi and has commended him for demonstrating \"transparency\" as he deals with the crisis.\n",
      "Trump said \"we have it totally under control\" when he was asked about the new type of coronavirus while in Switzerland last week to attend an economic conference. In a separate Twitter posting, he offered reassurance but scant detail for his confidence.\n",
      "\"China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,\" Trump tweeted. \"The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.\"\n",
      "But some public health experts say Trump's rosy assessments of the situation don't match the ground truth.\n",
      "Gostin pointed to Chinese government bureaucratic delays that led to tens of thousands of people travelling outside of Wuhan province, increasing the likelihood that the virus will travel far beyond China.\n",
      "\"It's not accurate at all,\" Gostin said of Trump's assessment of China's handling of the outbreak. \"China manifestly does not have this under control.\"\n",
      "Trump's budgets have proposed cuts to public health, only to be overruled by Congress, where there's strong bipartisan support for agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Indeed, the money government disease detectives are tapping to fight the latest outbreak was a congressional idea.\n",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services has accessed a $105 million fund lawmakers created to counter emerging threats from infectious diseases. That helps scientists to immediately deploy to help contain the outbreak, work on devising treatments for the virus, and investigate potential vaccines.\n",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., an original sponsor of the idea, said the rapid response fund has proved its worth twice since it was set up in 2018. It was also tapped to help confront the most recent Ebola virus outbreak in Africa.\n",
      "Trump's Democratic presidential rivals have zeroed in on his efforts to reduce financing for public health organizations.\n",
      "Former Vice-President Joe Biden and others have criticized Trump for eliminating a senior director position for global health security and biothreats at the National Security Council earlier in his term. Trump has also repeatedly sought budget cuts to the CDC and the National Institutes for Health.\n",
      "Congress resisted that, and the 2020 budget includes $8 billion for the CDC, $1.4 billion more than Trump's budget request. It also includes $41.7 billion for the NIH, $7.5 billion more than Trump's budget request.\n",
      "Biden wrote in an opinion article for USA Today this week that the \"possibility of a pandemic is a challenge Donald Trump is unqualified to handle as president.\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another Democratic contender for the 2020 nomination, tweeted that after the Ebola outbreak, Congress \"invested to prevent pandemics like coronavirus.

      "Dozens of American companies are scrambling to combat the spread of coronavirus and stem losses from the outbreak.\n",
      "But Apple, perhaps, stands to lose more than others: It relies heavily on manufacturing in China and on Chinese consumers as a key revenue driver. Although many analysts think it's too early to tell just how hard Apple might be hit by the disease, any major or extended disruption could hammer its production and sales in one blow.\n",
      "Apple had been looking forward to a turnaround in China. Last year, slumping demand hit sales numbers, and trade tensions caused uncertainty for its supply chain. But in the three months ending in December, sales in the region returned to growth, thanks in large part to the popularity of the iPhone 11.\n",
      "Now, fears about the spread of coronavirus may dash hopes of sustained improvement in the region — at least so long as the outbreak continues — putting a damper on an otherwise successful earnings report .\n",
      "\"The return to growth in China is very impressive,\" D.A. Davidson senior analyst Tom Forte said. \"Were it not for the coronavirus, the sustainability of (the performance in China) would not be called into question ... (It) is an important risk that investors need to monitor.\"\n",
      "The company on Tuesday projected revenue between $63 billion and $67 billion for the current quarter, which ends in March, a wider-than-usual range due to the uncertainty caused by coronavirus.\n",
      "All things considered, that guidance is pretty strong, said Synovus Trust Company senior portfolio manager Dan Morgan.\n",
      "\"If Apple was overly concerned about it, they might have given us more of an indication in their guidance,\" Morgan said.\n",
      "However, the outbreak is evolving rapidly. More than 7,700 worldwide have now been infected with the coronavirus, and at least 170 people have died. Chinese officials had already extended the Lunar New Year holiday from January 30 to February 2, forcing companies to keep their doors closed longer in hopes of stemming the spread of the virus.\n",
      "Some retailers, including Starbucks and Pizza Hut, announced that they plan to suspend store operations even beyond the end of the holiday, and some airlines are offering refunds to people who cancel their travels.\n",
      "CEO Tim Cook said on a call with Wall Street analysts Tuesday that Apple has closed one retail store and shortened hours at some of the others that remain open. He added that the company is regularly deep cleaning stores that remain open, and is conducting temperature checks on employees to avoid the spread of the virus.\n",
      "\"We're also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week,\" Cook said. \"The situation is emerging and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely.\"\n",
      "Cook said that while the sales at the Wuhan area store are relatively small, store closures at other Apple retailers and a general decline in retail traffic across the country could negatively impact sales. Sales in China make up about 15% of Apple's total revenue.\n",
      "But unlike some other retailers, Apple has more to worry about than just its consumer sales. The company's manufacturing — particularly the production of the iPhone — is centered in China .\n",
      "Apple has some suppliers in Wuhan, which is known as a manufacturing hub, and Cook said Chinese officials have delayed the opening of factories in that area from the end of January to February 10.\n",
      "The company aimed to factor the risk of lost production at those facilities into its guidance for the current quarter, and has developed a mitigation plan based on alternate sources, Cook said Tuesday. However, he said the impact of the disease on production facilities in other areas of the country is \"less clear at this time.\"\n",
      "Foxconn, one of Apple's main manufacturing partners in the region, especially for the iPhone, said in a statement Wednesday that it is following \"holiday schedules,\" indicating it does not plan to keep factories closed beyond what is currently required by Chinese officials.\n",
      "\"As a matter of policy and for reasons of commercial sensitivity, we do not comment on our specific production practices but we can confirm that we have measures in place to ensure that we can continue to meet all global manufacturing obligations,\" the company said. It added that having previously handled the SARS out break in the early 2000s, the company understands how to mitigate the effects of such an outbreak.\n",
      "That's likely a good sign for Apple, at least for now, Synovus' Morgan said.\n",
      "\"With the SARS events a few years ago, everyone got all upset but it didn't really do too much,\" Morgan said. \"They have a whole chip and hardware ecosystem (in the region), so if you start to see that having problems, that will be an indication that Apple could have an issue. If they do, then, yeah, maybe there's some risk going into the second quarter for Apple.\" \n",

      "Tweet: As the emerging Wuhan coronavirus outbreak dominates the daily news, you might be wondering just how the pathogen is working its way around the world. This virus travels from place to place by infecting one person at a time. Some sick people might not spread the virus much further, but it looks like some people infected with the novel coronavirus are what epidemiologists call “super spreaders.” What is a super spreader?\n",
      "Researchers currently estimate that a person carrying the Wuhan coronavirus will, on average, infect approximately 2.6 people .\n",
      "Recent reports out of Wuhan also cite a case of a single patient who infected 14 health care workers . That qualifies him as a super spreader: someone who is responsible for infecting an especially large number of other people.\n",
      "During an emerging outbreak, epidemiologists want to determine whether super spreaders are part of the picture. Their existence can accelerate the rate of new infections or substantially expand the geographic distribution of the disease.\n",
      "In response to super spreaders, officials can recommend various ways to limit their impact and slow the spread of disease, depending on how the pathogen is transmitted. Pathogens transmitted via air droplets, contaminated surfaces, sexual contact, needles, food or drinking water will require different interventions. For example, the recommendation for face masks would be specific to airborne transmission, while hand-washing and surface sterilization are needed for germs that can live for a while on surfaces. What are the characteristics of a super spreader?\n",
      "Whether someone is a super spreader or not will depend on some combination of the pathogen and the patient’s biology and their environment or behavior at the given time. And in a society with so much global connectivity, the ability to move pathogens rapidly across great distances, often before people are even aware they are sick, helps create environments ripe for super spreading.\n",
      "Some infected individuals might shed more virus into the environment than others because of how their immune system works. Highly tolerant people do not feel sick and so may continue about their daily routines, inadvertently infecting more people. Alternatively, people with weaker immune systems that allow very high amounts of virus replication may be very good at transmitting even if they reduce their contacts with others. Individuals who have more symptoms – for example, coughing or sneezing more – can also be better at spreading the virus to new human hosts.\n",
      "A person’s behaviors, travel patterns and degree of contact with others can also contribute to super spreading. An infected shopkeeper might come in contact with a large number of people and goods each day. An international business traveler may crisscross the globe in a short period of time. A sick health care worker might come in contact with large numbers of people who are especially susceptible, given the presence of other underlying illnesses. When have super spreaders played a key role in an outbreak?\n",
      "There are a number of historical examples of super spreaders. The most famous is Typhoid Mary , who in the early 20th century purportedly infected 51 people with typhoid through the food she prepared as a cook. Since Mary was an asymptomatic carrier of the bacteria, she didn’t feel sick, and so was not motivated to use good hand-washing practices.\n",
      "During the last two decades, super spreaders have started a number of measles outbreaks in the United States. Sick, unvaccinated individuals visited densely crowded places like schools, hospitals, airplanes and theme parks where they infected many others .\n",
      "Super spreaders have also played a key role in the outbreaks of other coronaviruses, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). A traveler sick with SARS and staying in a Hong Kong hotel infected a number of overseas guests who then returned home and introduced the virus into four other countries.\n",
      "For both SARS and MERS, super spreading commonly occurred in hospitals , with scores of people being infected at a time. In South Korea in 2015, one MERS patient infected over 80 other patients, medical personnel and visitors in a crowded emergency department over a three-day period. In this case, proximity to the original patient was the biggest risk factor for getting sick. Can super spreading occur in all infectious diseases?\n",
      "Yes. Some scientists estimate that in any given outbreak, 20% of the population is usually responsible for causing over 80% of all cases of the disease . Researchers have identified super spreaders in outbreaks of diseases from those caused by bacteria, such as tuberculosis, as well as those caused by viruses, including measles, MERS and Ebola .\n",
      "The good news is that with the right control practices specific to how pathogens are transmitted – hand-washing, masks, quarantine, vaccination and so on – the transmission rate can be slowed and epidemics halted. ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n",

      "The World Health Organization announced Thursday that the outbreak of a deadly and fast-spreading strain of coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency.\n",
      "\"Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen, which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.\n",
      "However, Tedros was adamant that \"the main reason for the declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries. ... Let me be clear — this vote is not a declaration of no confidence in China.\" He said that the WHO is deeply concerned about what will happen if the virus begins spreading in countries with weak health systems and that the purpose of the declaration is to help those countries.\n",
      "The declaration of a global health emergency can work to galvanize international funding. According to the WHO's procedures , the three criteria for such a declaration are that it is an \"extraordinary event,\" that it \"constitute[s] a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease\" and that it \"potentially require[s] a coordinated international response.\"\n",
      "The last time the WHO announced an international health emergency was in July 2019 over the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Before that, international emergencies were declared in 2016 for the Zika virus and in 2014 for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n",
      "Also on Thursday, the U.S. State Department issued a \"do not travel\" advisory for China.\n",
      "\"Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China,\" the advisory reads. \"Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus.\"\n",
      "The new coronavirus has sickened around 9,800 people worldwide and killed at least 213 , all of them in China.\n",
      "The WHO said in a statement that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.\n",
      "\"There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. WHO doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement,\" Tedros added. But the WHO also said that in certain circumstances, such as when there are many cases of transmission among a vulnerable population, such measures could be \"temporarily useful.\"\n",
      "The coronavirus drew worldwide attention after Chinese authorities began reporting cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan last month. They were able to pinpoint the cause to a previously unknown strain. Other forms of coronavirus, such as SARS and MERS, have been responsible for past international outbreaks.\n",
      "Health authorities believe this particular strain, known as 2019-nCoV, likely first spread from an animal. China's National Health Commission has said it is associated with exposure at a seafood market in Wuhan that also sold live animals.\n",
      "Since then, the virus has spread from Wuhan to countries around the world, including the United States, Japan, Singapore and Thailand. \"The vast majority of those cases are still associated with travel to Wuhan,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program.\n",
      "\"We know that this virus can cause severe disease and that it can kill, although for most people it causes milder symptoms,\" Tedros told reporters last week. The WHO said that about 20% of those infected experience severe illness .\n",
      "Experts find the new coronavirus particularly concerning for several reasons. First, the WHO said there is evidence that the virus could spread from human to human. \"The disease is mainly a respiratory disease passing via droplets from one person to another and mostly still through close contact,\" Ryan said.\n",
      "The droplets could come from sneezing, coughing or even talking. This is worrying because it is easier for a virus to spread quickly between humans compared with a virus transmitted from an animal to humans. Human-to-human transmission has now been documented in three countries outside China, Tedros said.\n",
      "Second, experts still don't know for certain what animal the virus originated from in Wuhan. \"Until we know what the animal is, there potentially could still be animals being sold in markets all across China that is spilling virus over into people,\" Matthew Frieman, a virologist with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, recently told NPR's Nurith Aizenman .\n",
      "And third, Chinese authorities say the virus has also infected medical workers — people who already would be taking serious precautions to protect themselves.\n",
      "There is currently no targeted drug to treat the virus, Chinese health authorities said. And there is no vaccine to guard against it. Tedros is calling on countries to \"accelerate the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\"\n",
      "Several countries, including the U.S., have started to evacuate citizens from Wuhan because of concerns about the coronavirus. As NPR's Bill Chappell reported , American passengers broke into cheers after their flight from Wuhan touched down Tuesday night in Alaska. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising that travelers \"avoid all nonessential travel to all of [China].\"\n",
      "Major airlines, such as United Airlines and British Airways, have suspended flights to Chinese cities.\n",
      "Chinese health authorities recently announced new sweeping measures to try to contain the new coronavirus by implementing a strict quarantine on Wuhan, a city of some 11 million people. \"There's no sense of when the quarantine might be lifted,\" NPR's Emily Feng reported from Beijing. \"The big problem is that people are going to have to return to work soon, when the Lunar New Year is over. Many of them are coming from villages where there are very few screening measures for the virus.\"\n",
      "China's government has come under criticism for not responding more quickly to the outbreak. But WHO officials have praised the Chinese response.\n",
      "\"The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak, despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the Chinese people,\" Tedros said. \"In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response.\" Copyright 2020 NPR.

      "Tweet: \\n Li Na’s French and Australian Open wins set a standard that no one has yet matched \\n Wang beat Serena Williams on her way to the fourth round, following on from her win over Ashleigh Barty at US Open \\n Wang Qiang’s Australian Open run shows Chinese tennis in need of a new star to follow in Li Na’s footsteps. It has been six years since China’s Li Na won the Australian Open. Her win came against the odds in a time when Serena Williams was dominating the women’s game, helpfully backed up by Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka and Petra Kvitova. Since Williams’ last win at a grand slam event at Melbourne Park in 2017 there have been 11 major finals won by nine different women. Only Simona Halep (2018 French Open and last year’s Wimbledon) and Naomi Osaka (2018 US Open and in Melbourne last year) have won more than once. In the same period all of the men’s singles slams have been won by three players: Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. The latter two have split the last seven slams between them. The last player to win a major outside of them was Stan Wawrinka at the 2016 US Open. In spite of it being a very open era for women’s singles, China’s hopes of another winner to follow hall of famer Li into the record books continue to go unfulfilled. Some thought it might be world number 29 Wang Qiang’s year after the 28-year-old stunned Williams in the biggest win of her career. Wang’s run ended in her next match against Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur – the first Arab player to reach a slam quarter-final. Last year Wang, China’s top-ranked player, knocked world number one Ash Barty out of the US Open fourth round on her way to a first quarter-final. Her career has kicked on in the past 12 months but still it might not be enough to go to the very top. Of the players behind her in the rankings, none have gone further than the quarters with the exception of Peng Shuai, who reached the last four of the US Open the same year that Li won the lot in Australia. Zheng Jie is the only other Chinese player to reach a slam semi – at Wimbledon in 2008 and Melbourne in 2010 – but that was before Li went all the way. Li became the first Asian slam winner when she won the French Open in 2011, barging the door down through which no other Chinese players have followed. There have been shoots of success in the junior game. Wu Yibing, now 20, was the boys’ world number one and won the 2017 US Open juniors, while 18-year-old Wang Xinyu has won two girls’ junior doubles titles (Wimbledon and Melbourne in 2018). Wang Xiyu, who won the girls’ singles at the 2018 US Open, was her partner in the Wimbledon win. Players of Chinese descent, who would also inspire Chinese youth in the way Osaka has done for Japan, are on the way up, too. American qualifier Ann Li, 19, made it to a career best second round at this year’s Australian Open. She finished runner-up to fellow Chinese-American Claire Liu at the Wimbledon girls’ final in 2017. \\n Spicy Sichuan + superstition = semi-final @wqiang92 is the first Chinese woman into a #WuhanOpen SF #WTA pic.twitter.com/vrw1AcFYwv \\n — Wuhan Open (@wuhanopentennis) September 27, 2018 \\n That success has not translated into the seniors – at least not in singles. China’s women are among the elite in doubles. Last year Zheng Shuai won the women’s doubles in Melbourne with Australia’s Samantha Stosur. There are no Chinese men ranked in the ATP’s top 100 players, Zhang Zhizhen is the highest at 137, but there are plenty of women inside the top 100. That’s still some way off former world number two Li, the benchmark of the Chinese game. Is it just a matter of time or is something else missing? It was in 2003 that the Australian Open rebranded itself “the grand slam of the Asia-Pacific” and it is fitting that it is the only slam to have been twice won by Asian players – Li in 2014 and then Japan’s Naomi Osaka last year. The event has continually set records for viewers and attendance year on year, largely driven by a growing cabal of Chinese fans, while Chinese sponsorship revenue has also swollen. “We’ve made no secret that China and the region are a major priority for the Australian Open, and that we take our role as the grand slam of Asia-Pacific seriously,” Tennis Australia’s chief revenue officer Richard Heaselgrave said after a record five-year sponsorship deal with Chinese baijiu producer Luzhou Laojiao in 2018. Back in 2008, Li advocated for the Australian Open to be moved from Melbourne to Shanghai. While she said it was because of the climate and because it was a shorter flight from her hometown of Wuhan, she had a point. China has big tennis events but there are only four slams, and the possibility of rotating Melbourne with Chinese and Japanese host cities has been raised in the past. A China slam would only drive the growth of the game and there is the money to make it happen. The WTA Finals in Shenzhen last year had the biggest prize pot in tennis, men’s or women’s. The ongoing Wuhan coronavirus might not be the time to raise it, but Melbourne has been a victim of the forest fires while Japan has dealt with tsunamis during last year’s Rugby World Cup and is still recovering from the Fukushima reactor event as it heads to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The tennis world might be waiting on its next Chinese slam winner but is a China slam first?\n",

These will be used to support the ongoing surveillance of the current coronavirus outbreak, adding to a large number of the devices already installed in the country. 700Kg of Oxford Nanopore sequencers and consumables are on their way for use by Chinese scientists in understanding the current coronavirus outbreak. (PRNewsfoto/Oxford Nanopore Technologies) More Oxford Nanopore is already working to support more than 100 public health laboratories in China , as well as a number of Chinese microbiology laboratories and global public health scientists, with a growing community of scientists taking part in the surveillance process. \"We are privileged to be working with a global scientific community to support their understanding of this outbreak,\" said Dr Gordon Sanghera , CEO, Oxford Nanopore. \"We hope that the nanopore vision of enabling anyone to access biological information, anywhere, can have a positive impact, and are immensely grateful for the community support as we work to rapidly optimise for this outbreak.\" The MinION sequencer was designed for broad accessibility. It weighs under 100g and is run with a laptop or special accessory, the MinIT, to perform data analysis. It streams sequence data in real time, allowing for rapid sequencing. It is well suited to rapid sequencing in distributed locations. Previously, the device has performed sequencing in rural or remote settings, for example in understanding Ebola, Zika or TB. \"We were able to generate results less than 24 hours after receiving an Ebola-positive sample, with the sequencing process taking as little as 15 to 60 minutes. We show that real-time genomic surveillance is possible in resource-limited settings and can be established rapidly to monitor outbreaks.\" – Josh Quick , University of Birmingham , Nature , 2016 https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16996 Rapid sequencing of the coronavirus has been one essential tool in understanding the outbreak. Sequence information is typically combined with location and time data to provide an insight into how the virus is spreading and whether it is changing. Oxford Nanopore's sequencing technology has been used in many of the early coronavirus genomes from China , including the first genome published in NEJM and the \"cluster\" of genomes that indicated human-to-human transmission that were published in the Lancet and the first genomes published from the US. Researchers in the scientific community have developed protocols for nanopore sequencing of nCoV; Oxford Nanopore is working with the scientific community in the optimisation of those protocols. If you are interested in following updates on the use of nanopore in this outbreak, please follow this post , and if you would like to get in touch for nCoV specific support, please use this form .\n",

American Airlines says it is suspending flights beginning Friday through March 27. Delta says its suspension will not take effect until Feb. 6 to ensure that customers looking to exit China can do so. Delta's suspension will last until April 30. Other U.S. carriers have curtailed service to China, while several European airlines have suspended it altogether.\n",

      "Airline passengers making their way to and from China are navigating an eerie scene as officials around the globe work to contain a new, fast-spreading coronavirus. China has reported more than 7,800 cases, including 170 deaths, and the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global emergency.\n",
      "Several major airlines, including Air France, British Airways and Scandinavian Airlines have suspended service to China. But U.S.-based United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines are still flying, though they have curtailed operations as passengers canceled trips. The pilots' union at American Airlines sued Thursday to block the carrier from flying to China because of the virus.\n",
      "One woman who flew 14 hours from Shanghai to New York changed her white face mask every four hours to make sure it was clean.\n",
      "'It was a bit gloomy,' said Joe Chang, a tech worker who flew from Shanghai to San Francisco after visiting his family for the Lunar New Year.\n",
      "In some cases, fear is turning into paranoia. On one flight headed to China from Amsterdam, passengers protested when they realized a man from Wuhan \" the epicenter of the outbreak \" was on the plane, said Chris Van Heesch, a 50-year old from the Netherlands. In the end, he was allowed to fly.\n",
      "At Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Bangladesh, passengers arriving from Beijing on Wednesday walked through thermal scanners to check for fevers. As their disembodied faces appeared on a nearby screen, most of their heads looked green, indicating a normal body temperature, but the machine beeped loudly when one man's forehead appeared red. He was shuttled to the side where a woman took his temperature with a device shaped like a bar code scanner. 'One hundred one degrees,' she called out.\n",
      "Meanwhile, an airport worker pushed health cards into departing passengers' hands urging them to contact health authorities if they have a fever within 14 days of arrival.\n",
      "'The number of infected people in Beijing is relatively low \" over 100. But it is much higher in Wuhan,\" said Mohammed Raihan, a Bangladeshi student who attends Capital Medical University in Beijing. \"That's why I've come back. All the schools and universities have been shut down indefinitely.'\n",
      "A similar scene played out in Kathmandu, Nepal, where masked passengers were greeted with large, illustrated signs imploring them to visit the health desk if they have symptoms including high fever, muscle pain, headaches or hemorrhaging.\n",
      "Health experts said Thursday there's significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and were concerned that in other countries \" including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea and Vietnam \" where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission. The new virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses, some of which cause nothing worse than a cold.\n",
      "Flight cleaning crews are taking extra steps to protect themselves. Crews already fully disinfect arm rests, window shades and other hard surfaces after international flights on United Airlines. But if a plane carried a passenger with suspicious symptoms, the cleaning crew will don face shields, goggles and long-sleeved gowns while they clean with a disinfectant approved by the Centers for Disease Control, said United spokesman Charlie Hobart. A plane would be taken out of service and fumigated if a passenger had a confirmed case of coronavirus, he said.\n",

      "Jarvan Lee, a 25-year-old student from New York, came to JFK to pick up family friends arriving from Beijing wearing a black mouth cover with two air filters. He bought it five days ago from Amazon for $30 and plans to wear it at the mall or anywhere else he's around a lot of people. 'I'm worried,' he said of the virus.\n",

      "Steve Rehkemper, CEO of Chicago-based Top Secret Toys, says he's suspending all trips to China for now. He visited Shantou, China, and as soon as he arrived in Hong Kong from the mainland on Jan. 14, he and all the other travelers had to have their temperatures taken.\n",
      "''I didn't get too excited, I knew I didn't have a temperature,\" he added.\n",

      "By Lindsay Dunsmuir\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy continues to show signs of good health, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Friday, even as he acknowledged that the coronavirus outbreak in China is a potential risk to the outlook if it is sustained.\n",
      "\"The U.S. economy is in a good place,\" Clarida said in an interview with Bloomberg Television, repeating a mantra the central bank has stuck to since it indicated that it plans to keep interest rates unchanged over the coming months, barring a significant change to the U.S. economic outlook.\n",
      "His comments contrast with U.S. consumer and factory data earlier on Friday which suggested the economy may be losing momentum. U.S. consumer spending rose steadily in December, but tepid income gains pointed to moderate consumption growth this year while a measure of manufacturing activity in the Midwest dropped to a four-year low in January.\n",
      "Earlier this week, the Fed kept interest rates unchanged in its current target range of between 1.50% and 1.75% in a widely expected decision and also said at the time it is closely monitoring the coronovirus outbreak in China, which has sickened nearly 10,000 and killed 213 people.\n",
      "Clarida's comments on both the economy and the virus echoed those of Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday, who said there were still grounds for \"cautious optimism\" on the economy on the back of an easing in the U.S.-China trade war and supportive financial conditions.\n",
      "The United States and other countries tightened travel curbs on Friday and businesses said they were facing supply problems because of the virus, a day after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency.\n",
      "It has caused the world's stock markets to drop, with all of Wall Street's main averages tumbling more than 1% on Friday over worries over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global growth.\n",
      "TOO EARLY TO TELL\n",
      "China's efforts to contain the virus, which have included its own travel restrictions as well as shutting businesses and schools, are expected to cause a sharp slowdown in the country's first-quarter economic growth.\n",
      "\"It is a wildcard,\" Clarida said, adding it was too soon to tell the impact it would have on Chinese, global and U.S. growth. \"If this were resolved in say a one- or two-quarter slowdown in growth, that's probably not something that changes the big picture, but I agree it's a challenging situation, we're going to keep on top of it.\"\n",
      "A period of prolonged disruption raises the risk of a spillover effect to the global economy and has brought forward investor predictions of when the Fed will cut interest rates again, to June of this year.\n",
      "Clarida, who has been upbeat about the U.S. consumer for months, appeared unconcerned by recent data, repeating that the consumer \"has never been in better shape.\"\n",
      "He also said he was not nervous about this week's inversion of the yield curve. The closely watched yield curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes was flat on Friday, after inverting during two days this week, in a bearish signal for the U.S. economy.\n",
      "\"That is really driven, not so much by an outlook for the U.S. economy, but globally when there is uncertainty,\" Clarida said. \"I am not today concerned about the inverted yield curve because I think it's not really reflecting the U.S. outlook.\"\n",

      "BEIJING (AP) — The U.S. advised against all travel to China on Friday after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a new virus that has spread to more than a dozen countries a global emergency. The number of cases spiked more than tenfold in a week, including the highest death toll in a 24-hour period reported Friday.\n",
      "The State Department’s travel advisory told Americans currently in China to consider departing using commercial means, and requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel “in light of the novel coronavirus.”\n",
      "“Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China,” it said.\n",
      "China counted 9,692 confirmed cases with a death toll of 213, including 43 new fatalities. The vast majority of the cases have been in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. No deaths have been reported outside China.\n",
      "In the seven days ending at midnight Thursday, the National Health Commission reported 596 cases have been “cured and discharged from hospital.”\n",
      "The U.N. health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.\n",
      "China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.\n",
      "Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and have noted with concern instances in other countries — including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea and Vietnam — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.\n",
      "Speaking to reporters in Geneva on Thursday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside China.\n",
      "“The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,” he said. “Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.”\n",
      "“This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China,” he said. “On the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak.”\n",
      "A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.\n",

      "Tweet: World Health Organization Declares Health Emergency on Coronavirus January 30, 2020 News | Tommy Weir BEIJING (AP) — The World Health Organization declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in China that has been exported to more than a dozen countries as a global emergency Thursday after the number of cases spiked tenfold in a week. The U.N. health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is. Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is transmitting among people in China and have noted with concern several instances in other countries — including Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human spread.

Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading g among people in China and have noted with concern several instances in other countries – including Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam – where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission. A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. BEIJING (AP) — China on Thursday raised the death toll to 170 and more countries reported infections from a worrisome new virus, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from China’s worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation. Russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak. It had been de facto closed because of the Lunar New Year holiday, but Russian authorities said the closure would be extended until March 1. Train traffic between the countries was halted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air traffic between the two countries continued, at least for now. Russia has not confirmed any cases of the virus. Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus. The man in the U.S. is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak. There have been cases reported of the infectious virus spreading to others in a household or workplace in China and elsewhere. The case in South Korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier. Human-to-human spread of the virus outside China has also occurred in Germany, Japan, Canada and Vietnam, and was a major reason the World Health Organization has convened its committee of experts Thursday to assess whether the outbreak warrants being declared a global emergency. The committee last week had advised the U.N. health agency it was too early to make that pronouncement. The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, a cousin of the new virus. The latest figures for mainland China show an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,736 confirmed cases. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, and one was in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Outside China, there are 82 infections in 18 countries, according to WHO. A second Japanese flight carrying 210 evacuees landed in Tokyo. Reports said nine of those aboard the flight showed signs of cough and fever. Three of Japan’s confirmed cases were among a group of evacuees who had returned on a government-chartered flight the previous day. A flight was also en route to China to bring back 350 Europeans. The U.S. said additional flights were planned for early next week after it evacuated 195 Americans from Wuhan on Wednesday. They are being tested and monitored at a Southern California military base. South Korea, Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and other countries were also trying to get their citizens out. Taiwan, the self-governing republic China considers its own territory, has also asked to be able to repatriate its passport holders from Wuhan, but it was awaiting approval from Beijing. Israel’s El Al , Spain’s Iberia, Scandinavian Airlines, Egypt Air and Korean Air joined the growing list of airlines suspending or reducing service to China. In South Korea, residents in two cities where quarantine facilities were being prepared threw eggs and water bottles at government officials to protest plans to isolate in their neighborhoods 700 South Koreans the government plans to evacuate from China. Amid reports of shortages in food and daily necessities in hot-spot areas, Chinese authorities are “stepping up efforts to ensure continuous supply and stable prices,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited Ministry of Commerce data showing current reserves in Wuhan can ensure a secure supply of rice and cooking oil for more than 15 days, pork and eggs for more than 10 days and vegetables for about five days. China’s highly developed online shopping and home delivery businesses were important in ensuring those confined to home by choice or by order could get food and other essentials. China extended its Lunar New Year holiday to Sunday to try to keep people home, but the wave of returning travelers could potentially cause the virus to spread further. Transport ministry spokesman Wu Chungeng outlined a series of rigorous temperature checks and other “severe measures” to detect possibly infectious passengers. Transport restrictions such as those isolating Wuhan and suspending inter-provincial bus services would remain in place, Wu said. “It’s definitely very challenging, but we’re confident we can exert effective control,” Wu told reporters at the briefing. The WHO emergencies chief, Michael Ryan, speaking in Geneva Wednesday after returning from Beijing, said China was taking “extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge” posed by the outbreak. To date, about 99% of the cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at 2%, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it’s likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed. In comparison, the SARS virus killed about 10% of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS. Chinese authorities have demanded anyone who traveled from or through Wuhan report to health authorities and self-quarantine themselves for 14 days, the maximum incubation period during which patients can be infectious even if they don’t show symptoms. China has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumors — a reflection of the one-party Communist state’s determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media. That stands in stark contrast to the initial response to SARS, when medical reports were hidden as state secrets. The delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide, killing around 800 people. ___ Associated Press writers Maria Cheng in London, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report .\n",

      "Tweet: US tells citizens not to travel to China as virus toll tops 200 Reuters 31st Jan 2020 09:31:13 GMT +0300 People who said they arrived from Hubei province after passing a checkpoint at the Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge head to the train station in Jiujiang, Jiangxi province, China, as the country is hit by a new corona virus, January 31. [Reuters] The US government warned Americans not to travel to China as the death toll from a new coronavirus reached 213 on Friday and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency. A new State Department travel advisory raised the warning for China to the same level as Iraq and Afghanistan. In a notice posted on its website, the department said: “Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China.” The death toll in Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the epidemic, had risen to 204 and there were 9,692 cases of infection nationally as of Thursday, Chinese health authorities said. A total of 129 cases have been reported in 22 other countries and regions, with no deaths outside China. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said all air traffic between Italy and China would stop, a more drastic measure than most countries have undertaken, after Italy announced its first confirmed cases in two Chinese tourists. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said the organization “doesn’t recommend - and actually opposes” restrictions on travel or trade with China. International alarm over the new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, in December, is driven by its rapid spread and the fact that infectious disease experts cannot yet know how deadly or contagious it is. An increasing number of airlines have stopped flying to mainland China, including Air France KLM SA, British Airways, Germany’s Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, while others have reduced flights. American Airlines’ pilots have filed a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt to China flights. A US flight attendant who recently landed from one major Chinese city said a big concern was spreading the virus to families or being quarantined while on a layover. “I didn’t understand the gravity of the situation until I went there,” said the attendant, describing general paranoia on the return flight, with every passenger wearing a mask. “Now I feel like I’m on a 14-day countdown,” said the attendant, referring to the 14-day incubation period for the virus, during which time Chinese health authorities say a person can be infectious. Australia’s powerful Transport Workers’ Union (TWU) on Friday called for the immediate suspension all flights from China. “Suspending flights originating from China may appear to be a drastic measure. But the consequence of inaction could be even more drastic. We need national leadership now,” TWU National Secretary Michael Kaine said in a statement. Foreign governments continued evacuating their citizens from Hubei and holding them in quarantine. The first of four planned flights carrying South Koreans landed at the Gimpo International Airport. Around 700 South Koreans have signed up for evacuation. South Korea will quarantine all evacuees for 14 days, even if they show no symptoms. Stocks around the world tumbled on Thursday as the rising death toll fueled fears of the economic fallout in the world’s second-biggest economy, but steadied slightly on Friday after the WHO praised China’s efforts to contain the virus In a news conference in Geneva on Thursday evening, Tedros said the WHO was declaring a global health emergency because it was concerned about the virus spreading to countries that did not have the resources to deal with it. “The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries. Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,” he said. The WHO move will trigger tighter containment and information-sharing guidelines to all countries, but may disappoint Beijing, which had expressed confidence it can beat the “devil” virus. China’s UN ambassador, Zhang Jun, said Beijing was assessing the declaration. “We are still at a very critical stage in fighting the coronavirus. International solidarity is extremely important and for that purpose all countries should behave in a ... responsible manner,” Zhang said. Lockdown in Wuhan The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a food market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Some 60 million people in Hubei province are now living under virtual lockdown. There had been a further 1,220 cases detected in Hubei by end of Jan. 30, taking the total for the province to close to 6,000, Hubei’s health commission said. New cases are being reported every day around the world, spurring cuts to travel, outbreaks of anti-China sentiment in some places and a surge in demand for protective face masks. Medical experts say the rising number of human-to-human transmissions outside China suggests a greater potential for the virus to spread further. Statistics from China indicate that just over 2% of people infected have died, suggesting that the virus may be less deadly than the coronaviruses behind 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). However, economists fear the impact from the virus could be bigger than SARS, which killed about 800 people and cost the global economy an estimated $33 billion, as China’s share of the world economy is now far greater. In China, thousands of factory workers on Lunar New Year holidays may struggle to get back to work next week due to travel restrictions. While major firms such as Alphabet Inc’s Google and Sweden’s IKEA have closed China operations.

      "Tweet: U.S. public health officials attempted to stymie concerns about the coronavirus during a press conference on Tuesday, emphasizing that most Americans are not in danger of contracting the illness and urging citizens not to take extreme measures in response to the low-risk virus.\n",
      "\"Right now, there is no spread of this virus in our communities here at home,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Robert Redfield, MD, said during the Jan. 28 press conference. \"This is why our current assessment is that the immediate health risk of this new virus to the general public is low in our nation. The coming days and weeks are likely to bring more confirmed cases here and around the world, including the possibility of some person-to-person spreading, but our goal of the ongoing U.S. public health response is to contain this outbreak and prevent sustained spread of the virus in our country.\"\n",
      "During the press conference, Department Health & Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II, reiterated there have been only five confirmed U.S. cases of the coronavirus thus far and all were associated with travel to Wuhan, China, where the virus first appeared. The number of confirmed cases in China, meanwhile, has risen to more than 4,500 with about 100 associated deaths.\n",
      "U.S. health providers should be on the lookout for any patient who has traveled to China recently, particularly to Hubei province, and they should pay close attention to any relevant symptoms, Secretary Azar said during the press conference.\n",
      "He defended the decision not to declare a public health emergency at this time, stressing that such a move is based on standards and requirements not yet met by the coronavirus.\n",
      "\"It's important to remember where we are right now; we have five cases in the United States, each of those individuals with direct contact to Wuhan and no person-to-person transmission in the United States,\" Secretary Azar said. \"I won't hesitate at all to invoke any authorities that I need to ensure that we're taking all the steps to protect the American people, but I'll do it when it's appropriate under the standards that we have and the authorities that I need.\"\n",
      "In the meantime, a number of efforts are underway by U.S. agencies to assess the nation's emergency preparedness stockpile, to assist American families in China with evacuation, and to pursue research into diagnostics and a potential vaccine for the virus, Secretary Azar said.\n",
      "With regard to countermeasures, the CDC has rapidly developed a diagnostic based on the published sequence of the virus, said Anthony Fauci, MD, director for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The National Institutes of Health and the CDC are now working on the development of next-generation diagnostics to better identify the virus in the United States and throughout the world, Dr. Fauci said during the press conference.\n",
      "Currently, there are no proven therapeutics for the coronavirus infection, Dr. Fauci said. Based on experiences with SARS and MERS, however, researchers are studying certain antiviral drugs that could potentially treat the virus, he said. This includes the antiviral drug remdesivir, which was developed for the treatment of the Ebola virus , and lopinavir/ ritonavir ( Kaletra ), a combination therapy commonly used to treat HIV . In addition, monoclonal antibodies developed during the SARS outbreak are also being studied.\n",
      "\"Given the somewhat close homology between SARS and the new novel coronavirus, there could be some cross reactivity there that could be utilized,\" he said.\n",
      "Most importantly, he said, vaccine development is underway. Since China isolated the virus and published its sequence, U.S. researchers have already analyzed the components and determined an immunogen to be used in a vaccine, Dr. Fauci said. He anticipates moving to a Phase 1 trial within the next 3 months. The trial would then move to Phase 2 after another few more months for safety data.\n",
      "\"What we do from that point will be determined by what has happened with the outbreak over those months,\" he said. \"We are proceeding as if we will have to deploy a vaccine. In other words, we're looking at the worst scenario that this becomes a bigger outbreak.\"\n",
      "Federal health officials, however, stressed that more data about infected patients in China is needed for research. HHS has repeatedly offered to send a CDC team to China to help with public health efforts, research, and response, but China has so far declined the offer, Secretary Azar added.\n",
      "In addition, the CDC has updated its travel advisory in response to the illness. The latest travel guidance recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to all parts of China.\n",

      "\"I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to U.S., probably some to Mexico as well,'' Ross told Fox Business Network.\n",
      "The new virus, from the coronavirus family, has paralyzed business in China. The industrial hub of Wuhan and other Chinese cities are on lockdown. China has reported more than 7,700 cases and 170 deaths.\n",
      "The crisis has also begun to ripple through U.S. companies with operations in China. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the company's suppliers in China have been forced to delay reopening factories that closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. More than half of Starbucks' stores in China are now closed. McDonald's has closed several hundred restaurants in China.\n",
      "Ross emphasized that he didn't \"want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease.''\n",
      "He added, though, that \"the fact is, it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain.''\n",
      "Even before the viral outbreak, many U.S. and other foreign companies had been rethinking their presence in China and considering their options for relocating elsewhere, possibly elsewhere in Asia. That is partly because President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese imports in a war over Beijing's economic policies and partly because Chinese labor and other costs have been rising.\n",
      "But skeptics doubt that many American companies with deep roots in China might abandon the country purely over the virus. For one thing, no one knows how long the viral outbreak will last or how much damage it may inflict. And it takes significant time for companies to choose suppliers or locations for their factories.\n",
      "Rosemary Coates, whose Blue Silk Consulting firm helps companies make such decisions, said it was \"ridiculous'' to think the viral outbreak would result in a significant return of business to the United States.\n",
      "\"You can't snap your fingers,'' she said. \"It can take 18 months or two years to find another supplier. It isn't easy. It's complicated.''\n",
      "Wuhan, a center of China's steel industry, has attracted General Motors and many other foreign manufacturing giants.\n",
      "\"You can't just say General Motors is going to pick up and move away,'' Coates said. \"They have a manufacturing plant there and expertise there. Their supply chain runs through there.''\n",
      "In fact, U.S. direct investment in China, which includes factories, continued to rise even after the SARS outbreak disrupted the Chinese economy in 2003. And labor costs will continue to remain far higher in the United States than in China and other Asian countries such as Vietnam.\n",
      "\"Companies that are leaving China are not coming to the U.S.,'' said Coates, who is also executive director of the Reshoring Institute, a nonprofit that researches issues surrounding corporate decisions on whether to return to the United States. \"They're going to other Asian countries .... If low cost is the only goal, then the U.S. is not the answer.''\n",
      "After Ross' comments drew criticism, the Commerce Department issued a statement: \"As Secretary Ross made clear, the first step is to bring the virus under control and help the victims of this disease,\" it said. \"It is also important to consider the ramifications of doing business with a country that has a long history of covering up real risks to its own people and the rest of the world.''\n",
      "Asked about Ross' comments, Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, declined to endorse the notion that the U.S. economy stands to benefit from China's health crisis.\n",
      "\"This is not about trade, jobs or any of that,'' Kudlow told reporters. He added: \"The president has a lot of compassion for the Chinese situation. The threat of large numbers of people dying is a terrible thing. We just want to help.'' Tags \n",

      "Tweet:  2 hours ago in PR Leave a comment The Australian Hotels Association (AHA) WA has congratulated the McGowan Government for providing additional funding of $2.85 million to help support WA’s tourism and hospitality industry as it faces dual pressures from the recent bushfires and the emerging threat of Coronavirus. AHA(WA) CEO Bradley Woods said it was important for additional resources to be made available quickly to entice interstate visitors to WA and offset the potential impact that the fires and the Coronavirus outbreak could have on local accommodation hotels and hospitality businesses. “This additional funding is very welcome and comes at a time when our local tourism, accommodation and hospitality industry is facing a virtually unprecedented dual threat from interstate and overseas events,” Mr Woods said. “The McGowan Government is to be commended for responding quickly to assist our industry during what is an uncertain period ahead.” “WA has been fortunate to be largely unaffected from bushfires this season and remains well positioned to accommodate holidaymakers and business visitors from interstate and abroad.” “There will be many Australians in other states that may be reconsidering their international travel plans – this new campaign may help entice such travellers to WA, where we have world-class destinations, an affordable array of accommodation options and an unparalleled food and beverage offering.” “This new marketing initiative will complement the Federal Government’s $76 million for tourism marketing as part of the bushfire recovery package.”\n",

      "Empty highways in a town of 11 million. Infrared footage of people in airports showing underwear styles. Masked travelers having thermometers aimed at their foreheads. Airlines reporting dropped bookings.\n",
      "So is this all it takes to spook Wall Street investors? Related: Steps to contain coronaviruses\n",
      "Apparently. And as we have come to know, what spooks stock and bond investors can also spook the cattle markets. So, is this a big event with long-term implications? After all, the number of cases of the new coronavirus is reported to be over 6,000.\n",
      "The SARS outbreak of 2003 never reached that number. The good news is that while the number of cases is larger in a much shorter time period than SARS, the number of deaths so far is 131 vs. 800 for SARS. So this disease is not as deadly. Some 20,000 people are rumored to being monitored in the Chinese source province. This virus has spread to 15 countries.\n",
      "Meat industry issues\n",
      "The problem for the meat industry is that things that interrupt travel and dining out and entertaining affect the demand for meat. As a result, live cattle futures were down $2.59 on Monday. Tellingly, the feeder cattle futures were almost unchanged.\n",
      "For the rest of the week, fed cattle futures showed glimmers of support early, but continued to slip lower as longs fled the market and the cash market for fed cattle was quiet, offering no direction.\n",
      "Clearly, the market’s concern is short term, not long term. But packers have been known to use any excuse to bid down cattle, so the markets are staying down for now. The good thing is, people in America are still eating and retailers and foodservice outfits will have to have more meat very soon.\n",
      "In fact, the wholesale market this week showed no signs of overreaction, with product continuing to flow at steady to slightly higher prices.\n",
      "However, stocks showed more concern. The Dow Jones average took a 450-point hickey for several reasons. Some of it is related to less commerce and less revenue, also related to travel, vacations, less shopping and spenders hoarding instead. Stocks like airlines and Asian casinos took big hits.\n",
      "Other factors are China itself. The “uncertainty” that both traders and investors hate was much remedied with the signing of the U.S.-China trade agreement. But with several big cities quarantined and travel difficult or impossible, businesses shut down and some of the population hunkered down at home, there is concern that the world’s largest economy won’t even manage the “tepid” 6.1% growth it had slowed to by the end of 2019.\n",
      "It could well be enough to slow it under 6%, the lowest growth in decades. The virus also feeds fears that China won’t be able to manage the purchases it agreed to under the trade deal.\n",
      "Experts in China disagree on when the disease will peak. One expert said another week or 10 days while another projected April or May for China’s biggest population centers.\n",
      "More than one stock market analyst characterized Monday’s drop as just an excuse or trigger for investors to hit the panic, er, sell button. The market has done well in recent months, the average of the S&P 500 hasn’t varied more than 1% since October. So the obvious signs of some economic and cultural distress were enough for some investors to take profits. Stock earnings multiples have climbed to relatively high multiples, further making some investors nervous.\n",
      "The U.S. economy is still perking along, and this being earnings season, it is worth noting that many of the stocks that dropped the most were ones that had already been showing stress for weeks. With 17% of the S&P 500 having reported earnings so far for the last quarter of 2019, 70% have exceeded estimates. But, as another analyst noted—and does this sound familiar to livestock folks?—people sometimes act on emotion, not facts. Do tell.\n",
      "The market did recover 253 points the next day, a long way from all the way back, but a sign that folks are realizing that it is too soon to decide the coronavirus is going to be a big factor.\n",
      "Where did it come from?\n",
      "The real wild card here is how this virus originated. Initial reports from the Chinese government attributed it to a seafood market, the kind of “wet market” in China where freshly harvested meat is set out on tables or live animals are harvested in the back of the stall for sale to customers. You might have seen photos of dozens of various critters all lined up on a tarp, just ready to be dressed and cut up for customers.\n",
      "Could this be a catalyst for Chinese consumers to begin regarding U.S. meat as higher in food safety than exotic critters whacked in the back of an unrefrigerated stall with dubious sanitation and food safety? Chinese consumers have been burned before in food and even baby formula.\n",
      "However, this is China and government proclamations are sometimes politically motivated or are major cover-ups even more bold than here. The Washington Times is reporting that an Israeli biological warfare analyst , a former Israeli military intelligence expert in chemical and biological warfare, contends the virus might have been created in a Chinese biological weapons lab that, according to China, doesn’t exist.\n",
      "The scientist said the only lab in China capable of working with deadly viruses is in the city of Wuhan—where the virus is said to have first appeared. To lend credence to this view, a rumor is said to be circulating on the Chinese internet claiming the whole thing is a U.S. conspiracy to spread germ weapons.\n",
      "Regardless, the stock market has calmed, the fed market is holding in place and 400 people crowded the lawn at the White House for the signing of the USMCA treaty. Serious worry is not in the cards, at least for now.\n",

The organization says that its greatest concern is the potential for the virus to continue to spread to other countries, particularly those with weaker health systems.\n",
      "“So far we have not seen any deaths outside China, for which me must all be grateful,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO. “Although these numbers are still relatively small compared to the number of cases in China, we must all act together now to limit further spread.”\n",

      "Thus far, the outbreak has caused China to request a temporary halt to tour activities in the country, shuttered major tourist sites and caused flight cancellations and cruise itinerary changes. Analysts have also warned that a drop in travel during the busy Chinese Lunar New Year travel period could have a negative impact on cruise and hotel companies that are heavily invested in China and the larger Asia-Pacific region.\n",
      "“From a macro, long-term perspective, travel is one of the most resilient industries in the world. Unfortunately, we are susceptible to issues like super viruses, natural disasters and world events that can impact our business,” Matthew D. Upchurch, chairman and CEO of Virtuoso , tells Luxury Travel Advisor . “We are working to provide our members from around the globe, including China, with a crisis management toolkit, ensuring they are armed with the most current information to share with their clients.

      "As of Thursday afternoon there were 7,834 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including 7,736 in China, which represents almost 99 percent of all reported cases worldwide. There are 98 cases in 18 countries outside of China, including eight cases of human-to-human transmission in four countries: Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the United States.

      "Tweet: WHO declares coronavirus a global health emergency 3:48 pm, Thu January 30, 2020 WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency. The declaration was made at a press conference Thursday in the United Nations building in Geneva. WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said the main reason for the declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries. The concern is that the coronavirus could spread to countries with weaker health systems. \"We don't know what sort of damage this virus could do if it were to spread in a country with a weaker health system. We must act now to help countries prepare for than possibililty. For all of these reasons, I'm declaring a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of novel coronavirus,\" he said. China's death toll from the coronavirus is now at 170. Chinese health authorities said there were 7,711 confirmed cases in the country as of January 29. The WHO said there had been 98 cases in 18 countries outside of China, but no deaths. There have been eight cases of human-to-human infection - in Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the United States. Dr. Ghebreyesus described the coronavirus as an unprecedented outbreak that has been met with an unprecedented response. On Thursday afternoon, Officials of the Jamaica's Ministry of Health were in a meeting to draft a response to the WHO's declaration on the coronavirus outbreak. Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr. Karen Webster Kerr said the Ministry was not yet in a position to speak in detail on the global emergency. The WHO's announcement follows a previous warning from Dr. Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme that the \"whole world needs to be on alert\" to fight the coronavirus. US person-to-person transmission The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed the first case of person-to-person transmission of the virus in the United States. The new patient is the spouse of the 60 year-old woman in Chicago who was diagnosed after returning last month from Wuhan, China. US health officials, however, pointed out the spread was among two people who were in close contact for an extended period of time. Six people in the US have now been diagnosed with the virus. The CDC said it does not recommend the use of face masks to prevent the spread of the virus.\n",

      "Tweet: Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestle are among the companies that contribute most to ocean pollution with single-use plastics, according to a study presented on Tuesday by the \"Break Free from Plastic\" initiative. The environmental movement, launched in 2016, has helped clear the coasts of 42 countries around the world of discarded plastics. \"These brand audits offer undeniable proof of the role that corporations play in perpetuating the global plastic pollution crisis,\" said Von Hernandez, the Global Coordinator of Break Free From Plastic, at the presentation of the study in Manila. Between September 9 and 15, over 10,000 volunteers carried out 239 plastic cleaning actions on coasts and other natural environments in 42 countries, Efe news reported. They collected more than 187,000 pieces of plastic, of which more than 65 per cent were from products by Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestle. But companies such as Danone, Mondelez, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever, among others, were also mentioned in the report. \"The companies have a choice to make. They can be part of the problem or they can be part of the solution\", Hernandez told Efe. \"If they continue the use of problematic and unnecessary plastic packaging they are just encouraging more production and more pollution\". Around 100,000 pieces of plastic collected were made of materials like polystyrene, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), PET (polyethylene terephthalate) or the film of single-use plastic that were not biodegradable, the report said. Plastic production has reached 320 million metric tonnes per year and is expected to grow by 40 per cent over the next decade, which will exponentially increase the release of greenhouse gases. Ninety per cent of plastics are produced from fossil fuels and pollutants. \"We must act now to demand that corporate brands reject their overpackaging habit in order to meaningfully reverse the demand for new plastic,\" said Hernandez. The study said that these large corporations must take responsibility for polluting the environment, as production of plastics exposes harmful substances to communities living near factories and pollutes foods and products contained in plastic wraps. Eighty per cent of the 8.3 billion metric tonnes of plastic produced since 1950 was still present in the environment, mainly in the oceans, according to studies cited in the \"Break Free From Plastic\" report. Since then, only 9 per cent of that plastic had been properly recycled and 12 per cent incinerated.

As their disembodied faces appeared on a nearby screen, most of their heads looked green, indicating a normal body temperature, but the machine beeped loudly when one man’s forehead appeared red. He was shuttled to the side where a woman took his temperature with a device shaped like a bar code scanner. “One hundred one degrees,” she called out.\n",

Crews already fully disinfect arm rests, window shades and other hard surfaces after international flights on United Airlines. But if a plane carried a passenger with suspicious symptoms, the cleaning crew will don face shields, goggles and long-sleeved gowns while they clean with a disinfectant approved by the Centers for Disease Control, said United spokesman Charlie Hobart.

      "“We’ll be adding additional hand washing stations and signage around the grounds to remind people of what the symptoms might be,” she said. “How to best work to defend themselves against them.”\n",

      "None of the domestic cases have been fatal.\n",
      "Every year, Fawkes said attendees and vendors completely book up hotels from Bakersfield to Fresno. That said, Tulare County HHSA has been in contact with hotels in the area as well — making sure they’re prepared to identify potential cases in guests.\n",

After the bell, NASDAQ futures pushed 1.3% higher on the Amazon results. Still, the flow of news on the virus remained bleak with China's Hubei province reporting deaths from the disease had risen by 42 to 204 as of the end of Jan. 30.\n",

      "Tweet: (CNN) The deadly coronavirus outbreak is leaping across continents after infecting thousands all over China -- and there's no end in sight.\n",
      "The number of cases skyrocketed this week, and the US warned its citizens not to visit China as a wave of panic and infections increase. Even the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency Thursday, saying the virus is now a risk beyond China. Here are the key developments in the US this week and what's next: A woman infects her husband in Illinois An Illinois woman suffering from the respiratory virus infected her husband, becoming the first case transmitted from person to person in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. Read More The couple are in their 60s, and the husband has underlying medical issues, the CDC said. The husband's infection makes him the sixth person with coronavirus in the US, including patients in Washington state , California and Arizona. \"We understand that this may be concerning, but based on what we know now, our assessment remains that the immediate risk to the American public is low,\" Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, told reporters. Coronavirus has killed 213 people and infected nearly 10,000 others in China, most of them in the hardest-hit city of Wuhan. Outside mainland China, there are 108 confirmed cases, including the six in the United States. More Americans set to be evacuated from Wuhan The State Department is planning more evacuation flights for US citizens in Wuhan leaving around Monday. No more details were immediately available. An American who was evacuated from Wuhan tries to flee California base Just days earlier, it evacuated nearly 200 Americans Wednesday from Wuhan. They are being monitored for symptoms for at least three days at the March Air Reserve Base near Riverside, California. If health officials determine they don't pose a danger and can go home , they will be monitored by local officials for the 14-day incubation period. They can choose to remain at the base for the two weeks. One unidentified person tried to leave the base, and was ordered to stay in quarantine for the entire incubation period or until otherwise cleared, Riverside County Public Health said Thursday. US issues its highest-level warning for China US officials are warning citizens not to travel to China after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global health emergency. State Department elevates China travel advisory Those currently in China should consider leaving, the State Department said. Meanwhile, the White House announced a new task force that's meeting daily to discuss the threat of the coronavirus. The task force will help monitor and contain the spread of the virus, and ensure Americans have accurate and up-to-date health and travel information, it said. The department has tried to dissuade Americans' travel to China in recent weeks in response to the outbreak. It raised the travel advisory on Monday from Level 2 to Level 3. It's now at Level 4. Hoaxes spread along with the panic As the coronavirus outbreak grows, officials in several US states are cracking down on false information about the spread of the disease. Coronavirus hoaxes are spreading in the US as the outbreak grows worldwide Most of the false information is originating online, spreading fear about the virus that has sickened thousands worldwide. In Los Angeles County, public health officials warned residents Thursday that a letter claiming a potential coronavirus outbreak in Carson City is fake. In a suburb north of Los Angeles, a high school in Santa Clarita also issued a statement warning against false social media reports on the coronavirus outbreak. School districts in San Diego and Arizona are also warning residents about fake images of news stories claiming the coronavirus is spreading locally. Faceook has said it's taking steps to prevent the spread of misinformation on the disease. It plans to remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories, and is urging leading global health organizations and local authorities to flag such information. \"This includes claims related to false cures or prevention methods — like drinking bleach cures the coronavirus — or claims that create confusion about health resources that are available,\" Facebook said in a statement. Some states push for tougher measures Some states are calling for tougher measures to help combat the virus. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee asked US federal health officials to expand screenings to passengers returning to the United States from China at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where the country's first confirmed case of the deadly virus entered. Inslee wants the CDC to collect passengers' health history and temperature readings. In Hawaii, the state closest to the coronavirus outbreak, officials are urging residents to avoid discretionary trips to China. There are currently no cases of coronavirus in Hawaii, and officials said there's minimal risk to people on the islands.\n",

      "“I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses, but there is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution’s high bar for an impeachable offense,\" Alexander said in a statement released Thursday night .\n",
      "In an exclusive interview with The Tennessean on Friday, Alexander defended his decision, saying he considered all the evidence and concluded that while he disagreed with Trump's actions, they did not warrant his removal.\n",
      "Sen. Lamar Alexander (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP)\n",
      "\"I listened carefully and came to the conclusion that the president did it and what he did was inappropriate and the Constitution doesn't provide for the Senate to remove him from office and take him off the ballot for something that's simply inappropriate,\" he said.\n",
      "Alexander said his decision heavily relied on the framers' of the U.S. Constitution.\n",
      "\"What the framers said was you should never ever have a partisan impeachment,\" he explained, while rejecting criticism that his decision was giving Trump a pass.\n",
      "\"I doubt that the president thinks that,\" Alexander said, pointing to his Thursday statement. \"What I said was that he did it and what he did was inappropriate.\"\n",
      "Tennessee's senior senator, who is retiring and not seeking reelection this year, had long been considered a possible swing vote on subpoenaing witnesses and documents during the impeachment trial.\n",
      "How he made his decision While weighing his options, Alexander said he tried to think about what former U.S. Sen. Howard Baker, who played a significant role in the Watergate investigation , taught him – to reach a decision based on what’s right.\n",
      "“I believe I’ve done that,” he said.\n",
      "Alexander explained his process, saying he asked himself three questions: whether more evidence was needed, whether Trump’s actions were appropriate and who should do something about it.\n",
      "Alexander said he the answer to the first two questions were no.\n",
      "On the third question, Alexander said, “In my view the Constitution says that it does not come close to reaching the high bar of treason, bribery and high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n",
      "Alexander said voters should be left to consider the president’s actions, in addition to the nation’s economy and low taxes, when making a decision in November.\n",
      "Overall, Alexander said he hoped his legacy of serving in public office, which dates back to the 1970s, remains that he approaches issues by carefully listening.\n",
      "“I hope that my legacy is that I tried to do the right thing not that I tried to invent a position that pleased people,” he said.\n",
      "Trump's action 'inappropriate,' Alexander says In his Thursday night statement, Alexander said there is \"no need\" for more evidence to prove some of the allegations against Trump, including whether the president asked foreign leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n",
      "He called those actions \"inappropriate,\" but said \"the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year’s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate.\"\n",
      "Alexander instead named another venue for deciding on the correct response to those actions: The polls.\n",
      "“The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday,\" Alexander said.\n",
      "In Thursday's statement, the senator reiterated claims from the GOP that regardless of the truth of the allegations against Trump, they were not impeachable offenses.\n",
      "\"If this shallow, hurried and wholly partisan impeachment were to succeed, it would rip the country apart, pouring gasoline on the fire of cultural divisions that already exist,\" Alexander said. \"Our founding documents provide for duly elected presidents who serve with ‘the consent of the governed,’ not at the pleasure of the United States Congress. Let the people decide.”\n",

      "Collins said Thursday she planned to vote in favor of witness testimony.\n",

Will four Republican senators, just four, rise to the occasion, do their duty to the Constitution, to their country to seek the truth?”\n",
      "Unlike Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Alexander has been less reluctant to speak out about the impeachment. Blackburn has been an ardent supporter of the president and has regularly spoken out about impeachment on Twitter and regular appearances on Fox News.\n",
      "As the trial got underway, Alexander said the Senate's trial does not need to be a circus.\n",
      "\"Just because the House proceedings were a circus that doesn’t mean the Senate’s trial needs to be,\" Alexander wrote in a Jan. 21 tweet. \"We have a constitutional duty to hear the case.

      "“I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses, but there is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution’s high bar for an impeachable offense.\n",
      "“There is no need for more evidence to prove that the president asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter; he said this on television on October 3, 2019, and during his July 25, 2019, telephone call with the president of Ukraine. There is no need for more evidence to conclude that the president withheld United States aid, at least in part, to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens; the House managers have proved this with what they call a ‘mountain of overwhelming evidence.’ There is no need to consider further the frivolous second article of impeachment that would remove the president for asserting his constitutional prerogative to protect confidential conversations with his close advisers.\n",
      "“It was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation. When elected officials inappropriately interfere with such investigations, it undermines the principle of equal justice under the law. But the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year’s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate.\n",
      "“The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday.\n",
      "“The Senate has spent nine long days considering this ‘mountain’ of evidence, the arguments of the House managers and the president’s lawyers, their answers to senators’ questions and the House record. Even if the House charges were true, they do not meet the Constitution’s ‘treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors’ standard for an impeachable offense.\n",
      "“The framers believed that there should never, ever be a partisan impeachment. That is why the Constitution requires a 2/3 vote of the Senate for conviction. Yet not one House Republican voted for these articles. If this shallow, hurried and wholly partisan impeachment were to succeed, it would rip the country apart, pouring gasoline on the fire of cultural divisions that already exist. It would create the weapon of perpetual impeachment to be used against future presidents whenever the House of Representatives is of a different political party.\n",

      "RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) — Jarred Evans, a professional football player in China, is used to wearing safety gear: a helmet and shoulder pads. But in the wake of a deadly viral outbreak, he's switched to a mask and medical gloves.\n",
      "“When you're dealing with life and death, it's a whole different ball game,\" he said in a telephone interview Thursday.\n",
      "Evans, 27, was one of 195 Americans evacuated from the city of Wuhan and flown to March Air Reserve Base in Southern California until authorities confirm they don't have the coronavirus that has sickened thousands and killed more than 170 people.\n",
      "Most cases are in China, but the outbreak has spread to more than a dozen countries, and the declared a global emergency Thursday.\n",
      "The U.S. on Thursday confirmed the country's first case of person-to-person spread of the virus, a man who is married to a Chicago woman in her 60s who got sick after she returned from a trip to Wuhan.\n",
      "Evans and the other evacuees, including children ranging from around a year old to about 13, are staying at the sprawling base where they received a battery of blood tests and were given nose, throat and mouth swabs, Evans said. Some test results won't be back for a week, he added.\n",
      "While the surroundings are fairly comfortable, Evans said Thursday that he and others are still being cautious about mingling.\n",
      "“I’m still wearing my mask and I’m still wearing my gloves,\" he said in a telephone interview. “We’re still not knowing who has it. I’m still taking major precautions. You don't know whether you're in the clear.”\n",
      "“Today a lot of kids were enjoying the weather,” he said, and the base provided scooters, bikes, footballs and soccer balls for them to play with.\n",
      "But at dinnertime, Evans added, “everyone’s getting their food and going right back to their rooms.”\n",
      "Those being held at the base 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Los Angeles arrived Wednesday morning. They aren't required to stay but had agreed to remain for at least 72 hours. Officials also can quarantine any of those evacuated on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "That happened to another American who tried to leave Wednesday night.\n",
      "Officials in Riverside County ordered the person quarantined for two weeks unless medically cleared sooner, said Jose Arballo Jr., a spokesman for the county's public health agency.\n",
      "The order was issued “as a result of the unknown risk to the public\" because the person had not undergone a complete health evaluation, the agency said.\n",
      "It can take up to 14 days for someone who is infected to develop symptoms, health officials believe. None of the Americans housed at base have shown symptoms of the virus since their arrival, Arballo said.\n",
      "Evans said he would remain until testing shows he is free of the virus.\n",
      "He is a professional quarterback who moved to Wuhan several years ago to play in a Chinese football league.\n",
      "The city of 11 million people felt joyful, he said, with residents getting ready for the Lunar New Year.\n",
      "Then, in a matter of days, “it turned into chaos\" as news broke of the rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak. Suddenly, Evans said, people were swarming pharmacies and stores to get masks and disinfectant spray.\n",
      "Friends translated the news for Evans, who speaks no Chinese.\n",
      "“I stocked up on rice, noodles, water, anything that could help me survive for a week or two,” Evans said.\n",
      "The Chinese government shut down the city. Buses, trains, taxis, and personal cars were banned. The military patrolled some streets.\n",
      "“That's when people, honestly, stayed locked in their homes,” Evans said.\n",
      "He compared the deserted city to an Old West ghost town.\n",
      "“I've never experienced anything like this before,\" he said. “Imagine new York city being shut down. I was completely scared at first, because I didn’t know exactly what was going to happen. I don’t speak the language, and my family is so far away.”\n",
      "Evans holed up in his home for a week and a half until he received the news that the U.S. Embassy was evacuating its diplomats and their families and other U.S. citizens.\n",
      "He was notified that a chartered flight was carrying some of the 1,000 or so Americans in Wuhan back to the United States. The flight was coming in the next day.\n",
      "Evans said he was told, “If you can make it there, you're on the flight.”\n",
      "“It was a race against time,\" he said.\n",
      "Evans found an acquaintance who drove him to the airport. The embassy notified Chinese authorities of the license plate number so he could pass through the guarded streets.\n",
      "Evans said he was No. 171 out of 195 people permitted on board.\n",
      "On the plane were two men in full hazardous material suits, who warned them about the seriousness of the outbreak. Nobody appeared sick but all of the passengers decided to wear masks throughout the flight, Evans said.\n",
      "The plane flew to Anchorage, where the passengers had health screenings, and then landed at March Reserve Air Base on Wednesday morning. The U.S. arrival was joyful, Evans said.\n",
      "“We were clapping, smiling, laughing ... there were cheers,” he said.\n",
      "Once he is cleared, Evans intends to visit his family. Then it's on to Switzerland, where is signed to play with the Bern Grizzlies this year. But he would like to return to Wuhan when the coronavirus outbreak recedes.\n",
      "“The community is amazing, the people in Wuhan are amazing. China is a beautiful place,\" he said.\n",
      "But the threat of the deadly disease has left its mark.\n",
      "“I’ve never experienced anything like this before,\" Evans said. “The weirdest thing is the threat of man. You can actually get this virus by shaking hands.\"\n",
      "“I'm a very hands-on person,\" he said, \"And for me to be quiet and not to interact with others has been one of the hurtful things that I have to do. But to protect myself, I have to do it.” More Health News\n",

Two members of the same family have tested positive for the Wuhan strand of the coronavirus, which has claimed over 200 lives in China so far and infected almost 10,000 across the world.\n",
      "The patients are believed to have travelled into the country recently, and are the first two to be tested positively in the UK after 190 tests have returned negative. These confirmed diagnoses make England the 23rd country or territory outside of China to be hit by the virus, and the third country in Europe.\n",
      "Chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty today confirmed that the two patients are in a high consequence infectious disease unit, with Guardian politics correspondent Kate Proctor stating that this is located in Newcastle. The hospital is yet to be identified but it has been speculated that the patients are being treated at the Royal Victoria Hospital, one of only four hospitals in the country equipped to deal with infectious patients suffering from the virus. The Mirror has since reported that the patients are being treated in an isolation unit in the RVI.\n",
      "The Department of Health has declined to reveal any further personal details of the patients, such as their ages or nationalities, and has refused to provide details of how long they have been in the UK or where they had stayed before becoming ill. It is unknown where they are Newcastle residents. It is also unknown how many people they may have had contact with before being diagnosed, and whether they are students. The BBC reports that sources claim the two patients were staying in a hotel in Yorkshire, before being taken overnight to the specialist centre in Newcastle.

      "ON DECEMBER 31, 2019, overseas news reported an outbreak of a \"mysterious\" respiratory disease spreading in China. By January 7, 2020, Chinese health authorities had identified the disease as a new type of the coronavirus, now referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV). Reports said experts suspect that the disease may have originated from wildlife being sold in a market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China.\n",
      "The coronavirus is a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).\n",
      "The nature of the disease and the speed of its spread raised questions about the need to declare a global health emergency. Local media reports in early January referred to wire agencies for information on the disease, noting the number of reported cases so far and the measures being implemented to contain it.\n",
      "Media's attention on the nCoV picked up in late January upon information that some individuals, who reportedly showed symptoms of the disease, have been quarantined in some health facilities in the Philippines. The media's coverage stuck with the facts and sought relevant sources such as the Department of Health (DOH) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",
      "But by depending on these sources, media reports, with the exception of some, failed to consolidate the data and information available, making it difficult for the public to keep up with the flow of important points for their guidance.\n",
      "CMFR noted reports from Manila broadsheets Philippine Daily Inquirer, Manila Bulletin and The Philippine Star; primetime newscasts 24 Oras (GMA-7), Aksyon (TV5), News Night (CNN Philippines) and TV Patrol (ABS-CBN 2); as well as selected news sites from January 20 to 27, 2020\n",
      "Straightforward\n",
      "CMFR observed that the media's coverage was cautious, avoided the tendency to sensationalize, and was careful not to cause panic. In reporting the suspected cases of nCoV in the Philippines, the reports referred to the findings of the health department and other health experts.\n",
      "Media reports were direct to the point. Tracking the spread of the disease, the coverage also took note of the preventive measures implemented by authorities to detect and contain possible cases of nCoV in the country. These measures include the use of thermal scanners and quarantine procedures in airports and harbors; the preparation of isolation rooms in some hospital facilities; as well as simple reminders on personal hygiene, frequent hand washing, the use of face masks, and proper etiquette when sneezing or coughing.\n",
      "Collating information\n",
      "DOH Sec. Francisco Duque III himself told reporters that there are \"still many blind spots on the novel coronavirus.\" With much still unknown about the disease, it is important that the media provide all the necessary information for the public's knowledge.\n",
      "Fortunately, some news accounts did organize the scattered information to serve as quick and easy reference for the public.\n",
      "Rappler on January 21 collated key information about the nCoV, such as when and where it emerged, and the severity of the disease. The account also looked into the nCoV's similarities with SARS and MERS, which are the two known severe strains of the coronavirus.\n",
      "A report by TV Patrol on the same day carried similar information. In addition, it described how the disease can be spread.\n",
      "An explainer by Aksyon anchor Ed Lingao on January 22, meanwhile, went into the details of the coronavirus. Lingao explained that it has six known strains. Four are \"benign,\" which cause common respiratory illnesses like the common colds and cough, which may sometimes lead to pneumonia or bronchitis; the other two are the deadly MERS and SARS strains. Also included was a brief history of the spread and recorded cases of MERS, SARS and the nCoV. Lingao, citing the DOH, highlighted good hygiene to prevent the spread of the disease.\n",
      "Continuing development\n",
      "In a press briefing on January 30, the DOH announced the first confirmed case of nCoV in the country. The patient, a 38-year-old Chinese woman, reportedly traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong on January 21, and was admitted to a hospital four days later. According to Duque, the woman was among the 29 people being monitored by the DOH.\n",
      "This development calls for increased vigilance on the part of the media. Succeeding reports should no longer just provide routine updates on the spread of the disease. News accounts must expand the discourse by seeking out more sources who could make sense of the situation, and more importantly, communicate more effectively life-saving information to the public.\n",

      "“Pound has held at around 1.30 to the dollar for the last few trading sessions - but any dip may be muted given greater certainty that Brexit will indeed occur on January 31,” said Daniel Marc Richards, MENA Economist at Emirates NBD. Even then, all eyes will be on the currency and whether the Bank of England adjusts its rate policy after the split.\n",
      "The value of the pound has moved back and forth on the heels of any Brexit-related news in the last three-and-a-half years. While a stronger pound has tracked the likelihood of a clean and business-friendly break from Europe, a weaker pound has been linked to a chaotic Brexit or no-deal Brexit.\n",
      "The general election result late December - which delivered a decisive win for Prime Minister Johnson - caused the pound to rally initially, because investors were encouraged the pro-Brexit majority would lead to a quick and business-friendly exit from the EU.\n",
      "Bank of England holds the key Currently, the consensus among analysts is the value of the pound will remain unchanged in the days after the January 31 Brexit deadline. However, key to the near-term outlook will be the outcome of any interest rate decision announced by Bank of England, which is meeting mid-day tomorrow. This does offer potential for heightened currency volatility.\n",
      "The central bank will be offering communication and fresh economic forecasts, which will have a bearing on the markets and also offer an insight of what the regulator might do in future.\n",
      "“The (Bank of England) decision is on a knife-edge given the mixed data we have seen over the past month, and we expect the central bank will remain on hold at 0.75 per cent despite some dovish noise from members,” Richards added. “However, the chance of chair Mark Carney deciding to go out with a bang for his last meeting in charge cannot be discounted.” (Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been credited with providing a deft hand in the tumultuous years after the 2016 Brexit referendum vote.)\n",
      "Buy into volatility The Brexit saga is far from over, though, given that negotiators have just 11 months to reach a trade deal in order to keep to the current timetable, which sets the end of the transition period at the close of the year.\n",
      "As Britain shifts its focus to the transition at 2300 GMT on Friday, the move will not be easy as the EU continues to take a hard line ahead of UK-EU trade talks that are due to begin on March 3. A number of issues need to be resolved by December 31, and Richards at Emirates NBD added that fishing rights and access to financial markets look set to be among the “early clashes”.\n",
      "Any market volatility stemming from any likely friction between the UK and the EU concerning the deal could create buying opportunities for the pound sterling, wrote Tan Teck Leng from UBS Global Wealth Management.\n",
      "The pound against the UAE dirham has slid about 1 per cent during the last seven days, hovering at about Dh4.77. Analysts said the current weakness of pound is due largely to global “risk-off” sentiment on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak that began in China could have a negative impact on Chinese, and potentially international, economic growth.\n",

      "Patients who came down with disease at the end of December all had connections to the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan China. The complex of stalls selling live fish, meat and wild animals is known in the region as a \"wet market.\" Researchers believe the new virus probably mutated from a coronavirus common in animals and jumped over to humans in the Wuhan bazaar.\n",
      "I visited the Tai Po wet market in Hong Kong, and it's quite obvious why the term \"wet\" is used. Live fish in open tubs splash water all over the floor. The countertops of the stalls are red with blood as fish are gutted and filleted right in front of the customers' eyes. Live turtles and crustaceans climb over each other in boxes. Melting ice adds to the slush on the floor. There's lots of water, blood, fish scales and chicken guts. Things are wet.\n",

But she says that's not fair. Like just about everyone else in the market. Wong is wearing a surgical face mask because of the coronavirus outbreak. She's heard about the links between the wet market in Wuhan, China, and the coronavirus but doesn't think something like that would happen in Hong Kong.\n",
      "\"It's much cleaner in the Hong Kong markets. It's so different from what's happening in mainland China,\" she says. \"When I go to mainland China and I'm trying to eat something, I'm concerned about what's in the food.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, this kind of market is not just an Asian phenomenon. There are similar markets all over the world — places where fish, poultry and other animals are slaughtered and butchered right on the premises.\n",
      "But researchers of zoonotic diseases — diseases that jump from animals to humans – pinpoint the wet markets in mainland China as particularly problematic for several reasons. First, these markets often have many different kinds of animals – some wild, some domesticated but not necessarily native to that part of Asia. The stress of captivity in these chaotic markets weakens the animals' immune systems and creates an environment where viruses from different species can mingle, swap bits of their genetic code and spread from one species to another, according to biologist Kevin Olival , vice president for research at the EcoHealth Alliance. When that happens, occasionally a new strain of an animal virus gets a foothold in humans and an outbreak like this current coronavirus erupts.\n",
      "The Tai Po market in Hong Kong does have some live animals besides the seafood but the selection is rather boring compared to the exotic assortment of snakes, mammals and birds on offer in some markets in mainland China. They're known to sell animals such as Himalayan palm civets, raccoon dogs, wild boars and cobras.\n",
      "The only live birds in Tai Po are chickens, which are kept behind the butchered pork section of the market.\n",

      "Tweet: Oil eases as virus outbreak shakes economic growth predictions * Oil benchmarks on track for fourth weekly loss * Saudi Arabia opens talks on possible Feb OPEC+ meeting * The virus could cut China's oil demand by 250,000 bpd (Adds Russia comments, OPEC January output, U.S. shale production data, updates prices) By Devika Krishna Kumar NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Friday but were on track for a fourth straight weekly loss, on mounting worries about economic damage from the coronavirus that has spread from China to around 20 countries, killing more than 200 people. Prices found some support after Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday that OPEC+ countries may react if there are significant consequences to the oil market due to the outbreak of coronavirus, Russian news agencies reported. Saudi Arabia has opened a discussion about moving up a scheduled March policy meeting to early February to address the outbreak's impact on crude demand. \"The cartel stands ready to act again if necessary but may accept the short-term pain for now on the expectation that the economic consequences won't be as bad as people fear and price will bounce back to more acceptable levels on its own,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. Brent crude fell 5 cents to $58.24 a barrel by 12:03 p.m. EST (1703 GMT), down 4% on the week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell 4 cents to $52.12 a barrel, down 3.8% on the week. The losses came after both benchmarks had risen more than $1 a barrel early in the session. Disruptions in supply chains and travel curbs prompted economists to temper growth expectations for China, the world's second-largest economy. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said the outbreak is likely to shave 0.4 percentage point from China's economic growth in 2020 and could also drag the U.S. economy lower. The outbreak could cut China's oil demand by more than 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter, analysts said. \"In our view, there still remains considerable uncertainty on the duration and economic impact of the virus,\" said Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas in London. Many companies planned to return to work on Friday after a week-long celebration of China's Lunar New Year holiday, but authorities have ordered businesses in many areas to stay shut longer to contain the disease. Growth in China's factory activity faltered in January. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.0 from 50.2 in December, China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction. A Reuters poll on Friday indicated oil prices should remain supported near current levels this year as political risks and OPEC-led output curbs offset growing supply. The poll of 50 economists and analysts was conducted mainly before the coronavirus outbreak. OPEC oil output plunged in January to a multi-year low as top exporter Saudi Arabia and other Gulf members overdelivered on a new production-limiting accord and Libyan supply dropped due to a blockade of ports and oilfields, a Reuters survey found. Still, global supplies remain abundant. U.S. crude production climbed 203,000 barrels per day to a record 12.9 million bpd in November, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report.

      "Tweet: Midnight military coups and backroom deals did not bring strongmen to power in former democracies that have joined the ranks of the world’s autocracies. Everyday frustrations over high health-care costs, poorly performing schools, corrupt politicians, and crumbling bridges drove those countries’ voters to elect populists, says Thomas J. Bollyky, Director of the Global Health Program at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of “ Plagues and the Paradox of Progress: Why the World Is Getting Healthier in Worrisome Ways .”\n",
      "Voters may turn to autocracy for better results, but, at least with regard to health, they are not rewarded for doing so. The Council on Foreign Relations recently published a study that shows that life expectancy has declined two percent on average in Nicaragua, Turkey, Honduras, and Venezuela relative to otherwise similar democracies that have not transitioned to autocracy. The unhealthful effects of autocracy remain robust even when accounting for economic differences and when excluding Venezuela and its collapsing health-care system, he writes for Foreign Affairs:\n",
      "Without pressure from fair elections or accountability to a free media, autocratic leaders have less incentive than their democratic counterparts do to engage in the hard work of sustaining health-care infrastructure and improving care for chronic diseases. Democracy also matters in the context of an emerging infection, like the novel coronavirus outbreak affecting thousands in China. Governments that protect civil liberties and encourage constituents to share health-care information are more likely than their autocratic counterparts to identify emerging infections and be transparent about them. They are also better able to sustain effective public health oversight and to forgo counterproductive censorship and quarantine measures that unduly interfere with citizens’ rights and spread distrust and disease.\n",

      "NEW YORK (AP) — The dangerous virus spreading through China threatens a wide range of industries with ties to the world’s second largest economy.\n",
      "Chinese authorities have cut off access to Wuhan, where the virus originated, and 16 other cities to prevent further spread of the virus, affecting more than 50 million people. The financial and economic hub of Hong Kong has cut all rail links to the mainland.\n",
      "Many of the world's largest companies rely on Chinese consumers for revenue and factories for supplies. For example, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the virus outbreak has already caused some of Apple's suppliers in China to delay reopening their factories until Feb. 10 and some stores selling products already have temporarily closed or reduced their operating hours.\n",
      "“The situation is emerging and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely,\" Cook said.\n",
      "The virus could shave as much as 1.2 percentage points off China’s economic growth, according to “a back of the envelope calculation” by S&P Global Ratings last week. The International Monetary Fund earlier this month issued a forecast for 6% growth for China in 2020.\n",
      "Airlines proved to be the most visible barometer of fear as the virus spread. America Airlines has cut back some flights to Shanghai and Beijing because of lower demand. It's shares, along with Delta Air Lines and United Airlines Holdings, lost ground as reports of new cases surfaced. The industry had been seeing a strong demand for travel, which pushed up prices and left fewer empty seats.\n",
      "Resorts, including Wynn and Las Vegas Sands slumped as the virus forced travelers to cancel trips to the gambling haven of Macao. Both companies get the majority of their revenue from China.\n",
      "Technology companies, especially chipmakers, are particularly sensitive to China’s economic health. The sector is still poised to benefit from the easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, but the unknown economic damage from the virus in China created more uncertainty for the sector.\n",
      "Some retailers will likely see their revenue reduced. Starbucks has shut down about half of its stores in China and decided to forgo raising its profit forecast. Nike and Tapestry, which owns luxury brands like Coach and Kate Spade, both get nearly 15% of their revenue from mainland China. and stand to feel the pain of a consumer pullback.\n",
      "Still, market experts are reminding investors to take a long-term view.\n",
      "“Revenue and earnings will be impacted, but right now it’s an impact that is very short term in nature’,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.\n",
      "The virus outbreak at the moment is overshadowing the preliminary trade deal the U.S. and China signed in mid-January that raised hopes for businesses that relations between the two countries would improve. Businesses were expected to increase spending after holding back for much of 2019 because of the uncertainty over trade relations.\n",
      "China will likely take measures to stimulate its economy to make up for any damage from the virus and businesses could see a strong bounce once the situation stabilizes, Hooper said. In the long term, U.S.-China trade relations are going to have a bigger impact on companies and the global economy.\n",

      "By ZBC Reporter BOTSWANA has registered its first-ever suspected case of CORONAVIRUS. The suspected case was registered at Sir Seretse Khama International airport upon arrival using Ethiopian Airways from China. The suspected case becomes the first in the region since the outbreak in China which has killed over 200 people. CORONAVIRUS has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, as the outbreak continues to spread outside China.“The main reason is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, making the announcement at a press conference in Geneva. The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems. At least 213 people have died from the virus in China. The WHO said there had been 98 cases in 18 other countries, but no deaths. Most cases have emerged in people who have travelled from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began. However, there have been eight cases of human-to-human infection – in Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the United States. Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, Dr Tedros described the virus as an “unprecedented outbreak” that has been met with an “unprecedented response”. Coronavirus outbreak According to WHO Data based on the first 425 cases confirmed in Wuhan. The average age of those infected is 59, 89% were not hospitalised until at least five days of illness, 56% of the cases were men, 55% of cases diagnosed before 1 January were linked to seafood market according to The New England Journal of Medicine. The WHO declares a Public Health Emergency of International Concern when there is “an extraordinary event which is determined… to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease”. The WHO has previously declared five global public health emergencies. The Swine flu, in 2009 – The H1N1 virus spread across the world in 2009, killing more than 200,000 people, and a public health emergency was called to ensure the world was carefully monitoring its spread and able to respond, including with vaccines. Polio, in 2014 – Although closer than ever to eradication in 2012, polio numbers rose in 2013. An emergency was declared due to fears the global fight against its eradication could face a major setback. Zika, 2016 – The WHO declared Zika a public health emergency in 2016 after the disease spread rapidly through the Americas. Although for many Zika symptoms are mild, it can be dangerous for pregnant women and the emergency was called to spur urgent research. Ebola, 2014 and 2019 – The first emergency over the virus lasted from August 2014 to March 2016 as almost 30,000 people were infected and more than 11,000 died in West Africa. The WHO cited “the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems” in affected countries. A second emergency was declared last year as an outbreak spread in DR Congo.\n",

      "It's the sixth confirmed case of the new coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, in the U.S.\n",
      "In addition to the Illinois cases, two have been confirmed in California, one in Arizona and one in Washington state. Worldwide, the Wuhan coronavirus has spread to at least 20 countries since it was identified last month, the CDC says.\n",
      "Illinois health officials are investigating 21 other possible cases in the state. Overall, Redfield noted, \"the immediate risk to the American public is low.\"\n",
      "The CDC says the relatively few people who have been identified as close contacts of people with confirmed coronavirus infections should follow the guidance of their doctors and health departments.\n",
      "The agency is investigating 92 other possible cases across the country. An additional 68 were investigated and tested negative.\n",
      "Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, explained that this person-to-person transmission was \"between two very close contacts, a wife and a husband.\"\n",
      "She emphasized that the risk to the public in Illinois remains low. \"The virus is not spreading widely across the community,\" she said.\n",
      "She notes that Illinois public health officials \"are actively monitoring close contacts, including health care workers.\"\n",
      "Globally, there are more than 7,800 confirmed cases of infection with the virus. Person-to-person spread had already been observed in other countries, said Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\n",
      "\"This is a very serious public health situation,\" she said. \"CDC and our state and local health partners are working to prevent community transmission from happening here.\"\n",
      "\"Moving forward, we can expect to see more cases, and more cases means the potential for more person-to-person spread,\" she said. \"We're trying to strike a balance in our response right now. We want to lean forward and to be aggressive but we want our actions to be evidence-based and appropriate to the current circumstance.\"\n",
      "The CDC says members of the public do not need to wear masks out of concern for the coronavirus.\n",
      "To reduce the chance of spreading any respiratory illness, the CDC recommends that people take simple steps such as washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoiding close contact with anyone who is sick.\n",
      "People returning from Wuhan and other areas of high-risk in China should be vigilant for signs of illness, including fever and cough, according to the CDC. Those people should call their health care provider if symptoms do develop.\n",

      "The gap between the yield on three-month and 10-year Treasuries at one point slipped to as low as minus 2 basis points on Thursday. The spread -- seen by some as a warning signal because it has inverted before each of the past seven U.S. recessions -- last reached those levels as economic conditions deteriorated at the height of the trade war.\n",
      "© Bloomberg Drop in longer dated yields inverts 3-month, 10-year spread With the coronavirus outbreak threatening to disrupt the Chinese economy, concerns about the business cycle are undoubtedly a factor. But more important still are emerging doubts over the ability and commitment of policy makers to shore up growth and spur inflation.\n",
      "The inversion has deepened since Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues kept rates unchanged this week and signaled they would pull out all the stops to combat a global disinflationary downdraft.\n",
      "Following his press conference Wednesday, fed funds futures showed increased conviction by traders that a cut is coming this year, although they continue to price in just one quarter-point reduction. Meanwhile, inflation-linked debt markets are expressing doubts that price pressures will increase, with so-called breakeven rates slipping in the wake of Powell’s comments.\n",
      "“The bond market is basically telling the Fed that it hasn’t done enough and will be called back to do more and that the longer they wait the more they will have to do,” said Michael Darda, market strategist at MKM Partners. “If the bond market thought Powell’s comments on wanting higher inflation were credible in his press conference, you wouldn’t have seen break-even inflation rates falling as they did.”\n",

      "A measure of core U.S. inflation released Thursday showed price pressures slowed to an annualized 1.3% in the fourth quarter from 2.1%, a weaker figure than analysts had expected.\n",
      "Derailed Optimism The yield curve has historically reflected the market’s sense of the economy, particularly about inflation. Investors who think inflation will increase typically demand higher yields to offset its effect. Because price growth usually comes from a strong economy, an upward-sloping curve generally means that investors have upbeat expectations.\n",
      "The spread of the deadly virus from China has derailed new-year optimism among investors and thrown a spotlight on the ability of policy makers to handle a downturn. Merian Global Investors reckons the market is screaming for more easing. Societe Generale SA expects a 100-basis-point drop in the policy rate this year.\n",
      "“People are looking for some form of safety and buying Treasuries out the curve is really the only way to do it,”said Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson Group Plc. “The Fed has been adamant about pumping as much liquidity into the market as possible. And you could see the Fed try to pump even more in over time if this risk-off scenario continues -- to try to normalize the curve a little bit and bring front-end rates down.”\n",
      "Falling yields also triggered other market dynamics which are exacerbating the move. Convexity hedging -- when mortgage portfolio managers buy or sell bonds to manage their duration exposure -- is back in play. As yields fall, they make purchases. The yield on 10-year Treasuries dipped as low as 1.53% on Thursday, the lowest since October.\n",
      "The sequence of a swift drop in yields and curve flattening unleashing convexity-linked forces that re-starts the cycle is a recurring feature of the Treasury market .\n",
      "A massive wave of convexity-related hedging in the swaps market in March helped send 10-year yields to levels then not seen since 2017. That came after the Fed took an abrupt shift away from policy tightening they had been doing in 2018. The Fed went on to cut rates three times over all of 2019.\n",
      "Other factors may be at work now as well. Structural demand for long-dated Treasuries -- linked to liability-driven investment and hedging from foreign investors including Taiwanese insurers -- has helped to drive the curve flatter, according to Citigroup Inc.\n",
      "© Bloomberg Yield on 10-year Treasuries drops to lowest since October Pascal Blanque, the chief investment officer at Amundi SA, said the market shouldn’t read too much into the latest yield-curve inversion.\n",
      "“We don’t see these recent movements as indicators of a global or U.S. recession, but as an overreaction of financial markets that usually happens under these circumstances,” he said. The Fed’s decision Wednesday suggests that “despite the warning sign, there is no immediate need for further stimulus,” he said.\n",
      "Still, the death toll from the coronavirus is climbing, and it means investors are likely to remain cautious. The risk of reduced economic activity is raising a chance of rate cuts, according to ING Bank NV.\n",
      "The inversion “highlights broader market fears that the virus and its human and economic threat could spread,” wrote James Knightley, chief international economist at the bank. “The more that it does, the more likely it starts to alter consumer and corporate behavior, thereby promoting policy action to mitigate the dangers.”\n",

      "BEIJING — World health officials expressed “great concern” Wednesday that a dangerous new virus is starting to spread between people outside of China, a troubling development as China and the world frantically work to contain the outbreak. For a second day, the number of infections grew dramatically.\n",
      "The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. On Wednesday, the number of cases jumped to 5,974, surpassing the 5,327 people diagnosed with SARS.\n",
      "The death toll, which stood at 132 Wednesday, is still less than half the number who died in China from SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Scientists say there are many questions to be answered about the new virus, including just how easily it spreads and how severe it is.\n",
      "In a report published Wednesday, Chinese researchers suggested that person-to-person spread among close contacts occurred as early as mid-December. Based on the first 425 confirmed cases, the researchers estimate that each infection led to 2.2 others on average. That’s a bit more than ordinary flu but far less than some other respiratory diseases such as whooping cough and tuberculosis. The rate for SARS, a cousin to this new virus, was estimated to be 3.\n",
      "“Considerable efforts” will be needed to control the spread if this ratio holds up elsewhere, researchers wrote in the report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n",
      "More than half of the cases in which symptoms began before Jan. 1 were tied to a seafood market, but only 8% of cases after that have been, researchers found. They reported the average incubation period was five days.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief said the few cases of human-to-human spread of the virus outside China — in Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam — were of “great concern” and were part of the reason the U.N. health agency’s director-general was reconvening a committee of experts on Thursday to assess whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency.\n",
      "Dr. Michael Ryan spoke at a news conference in Geneva after returning from a trip to Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior government leaders. He said China was taking “extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge” posed by the outbreak.\n",
      "To date, about 99% of the nearly 6,000 cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at 2%, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it’s likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed.\n",
      "In comparison, the SARS virus killed about 10% of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS.\n",
      "Ryan noted there were several aspects of the new virus outbreak that are extremely worrying, citing the recent rapid spike in cases in China. He said that while scientists believe the outbreak was sparked by an animal virus, it’s unclear if there are other factors driving the epidemic.\n",
      "“Without understanding that, it’s very hard to put into context the current transmission dynamics,” he said.\n",
      "Meanwhile, countries began evacuating their citizens from the Chinese city hardest-hit by the virus. Chartered planes carrying about 200 evacuees each arrived in Japan and the United States as other countries planned similar evacuations from the city of Wuhan, which authorities have shut down to try to contain the virus.\n",
      "The U.S. plane arrived in California after a refueling stop in Alaska. All 201 passengers, who included diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, passed health screenings in China and Anchorage, and were to undergo three days of monitoring at a Southern California military base to ensure they show no signs of the illness.\n",
      "“The whole plane erupted into cheers when the crew welcomed them back to the United States,” Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer, told reporters in Anchorage.\n",
      "Four passengers on the evacuation flight to Japan had coughs and fevers, and two were diagnosed with pneumonia. It wasn’t clear whether they were infected with the new virus, which first appeared in Wuhan in December. Its symptoms, including cough and fever and in severe cases pneumonia, are similar to many other illnesses.\n",
      "Takeo Aoyama, an employee at Nippon Steel Corp.’s subsidiary in Wuhan, told reporters he was relieved to return home.\n",
      "“We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly and we were still in the city,” Aoyama said, his voice muffled by a white surgical mask.\n",
      "The first cases in the Middle East were confirmed Wednesday, a family of four from Wuhan that was visiting the United Arab Emirates. Airlines around the world announced they were cutting flights to China, and Hong Kong was suspending rail travel to and from the mainland at midnight.\n",
      "The number of cases in China rose to 1,459 from the previous day, a smaller increase than the 1,771 new cases reported Tuesday. Australia, Finland and Singapore were among those reporting new cases, as the number outside China topped 70. The vast majority are people who came from Wuhan.\n",
      "Australia, New Zealand and Britain were among the latest countries to announce they are planning evacuations.\n",
      "British health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that “anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.” The measures are a step up from those during the devastating 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, when returning travelers from West Africa were asked to monitor themselves for symptoms.\n",
      "Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said the steps are justified to prevent the introduction of the virus and its spread.\n",
      "“There’s always a balance between the draconian measures of public health and what people might want to do, and obviously it’s regrettable if people who turn out not to have the virus are quarantined unnecessarily,” he said.\n",
      "In China’s Hubei province, 17 cities including Wuhan have been locked down, trapping more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed.\n",
      "During the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, China was slammed for hiding that outbreak for months, allowing it to spread unchecked before reporting it to the WHO. Even after inviting international experts to investigate the epidemic, SARS patients were moved from hospitals and driven around in ambulances to conceal the true extent of the virus’ spread.\n",

      "The Federal Chief Medical Officer distributed this statement on the Novel coronavirus update as at 6pm 21 January 2020\n",
      "The Australian Government Department of Health is working across agencies to implement additional measures to manage the risk of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from the region of Wuhan in China.\n",
      "I want to reassure Australians that to date there have been no confirmed cases in Australia and the risk of transmission in Australia from this novel coronavirus remains low.\n",
      "We have well established mechanisms to detect and respond to ill travellers, and processes in place to implement further measures if the risk increases.\n",
      "This is a rapidly evolving matter with developments in recent days and we remain alert but not alarmed.\n",
      "Recent developments include significant increases in reported cases, and evidence of limited human-to-human transmission.\n",
      "After consulting other Government agencies and the states and territories, we are now undertaking evidence based, proportionate additional border measures, particularly in relation to the three weekly direct flights from Wuhan to Sydney.\n",
      "All passengers on these direct flights will receive information about the virus on arrival requesting that they identify themselves to biosecurity officers at the airport if they are unwell. If they have symptoms of an infectious disease they will be assessed by NSW Health.\n",
      "Additional information will be displayed at all major international ports around Australia, with instructions on what to do if travellers have symptoms or if symptoms develop.\n",
      "We are currently working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to update the travel advisory to Wuhan.\n",
      "We are also preparing updated advice for doctors and other health professionals in Australia and will be providing advice on the Department of Health’s website.\n",
      "Australia’s public health systems have identified a number of individuals who have presented with relevant symptoms and travel history to Wuhan.\n",
      "So far, all but one have been cleared of the novel coronavirus. Laboratory testing results are pending on one remaining case in Queensland.\n",
      "Key details of the evolving situation and suspected cases in Australia are shared across jurisdictions through key expert bodies such as the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and its standing committee, the Communicable Diseases Network Australia.\n",
      "Australia has world-class public health systems in place to manage any cases, including isolation facilities in each state and territory.\n",
      "There is currently no vaccine available for this new virus; supportive care is the best available treatment if a case is confirmed.\n",
      "Background Coronaviruses are ubiquitous—there are many known viruses in humans and animals including some viruses that cause the common cold.\n",
      "This novel virus was first detected in the City of Wuhan in China around 30 December 2019.\n",
      "As of 21 January 2020, 198 confirmed cases of this virus have been detected in the Wuhan region of China, with three deaths.\n",
      "Twenty-three additional cases have been detected in individuals in Beijing and Guangdong Province (China), Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Some of these individuals have reported a history of travel to Wuhan.\n",
      "Since 17 January 2020, 136 new cases have been identified in patients in Wuhan with previously unexplained pneumonia.\n",
      "All reported cases are adults.\n",
      "The recent increase in the number of cases has been partially due to increased surveillance and testing of cases.\n",
      "There is likely to be under-reporting and detection, particularly of mild cases, and true numbers are likely to be significantly greater.\n",
      "A number of clinical symptoms have been reported, fever was the single consistent symptom. Other symptoms include breathing difficulty, coughing and a sore throat.\n",
      "Among the reported cases, a proportion have experienced severe symptoms, including three deaths in China, with one individual known to have underlying disease.\n",
      "There is not enough data to assess clinical severity yet, however, on current evidence, the virus is not thought to be as clinically severe as SARS or MERS and investigations are ongoing. The ability of the new coronavirus to spread is strengthening and infections could continue to rise. The Federal Government has told doctors and GP surgery staff to wear face masks when seeing potential coronavirus cases and it will dip into the national mask stockpile to make sure there are enough to go around. Key points: The Federal Government will release masks from a national stockpile to ensure there are enough Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy stressed there was no need for members of the public to wear masks Professor Murphy said people around the country were being tested for coronavirus every day, with most returning negative results\n",
      "Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said he had spoken to the president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners on Tuesday morning and advised that the masks be used for consultations.\n",
      "\"We want GPs to put a mask on the patient and the staff and the doctor when they are assessing the patient. That's important advice,\" Professor Murphy said.\n",
      "\"We are investigating the supply issue. If it is difficult and impossible for some of them to get them, we will make sure they will get them.\"\n",
      "Health Minister Greg Hunt said there was a national medical stockpile of 12 million masks which would be sent where they were needed.\n",
      "\"We will work to make sure that everybody who needs them has them,\" he said.\n",
      "As of today it is being reported that the new coronavirus sweeping the globe is of “pandemic potential”, this according to the Federal Health Minister The Hon. Greg Hunt declared as he said new cases will be confirmed in Australia.\n",
      "Border protection measures are being put in place to deal with an influx of Australians returning from China after Luna New Year celebrations.\n",
      "Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed he had spoken with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to discuss ways the two countries could assist their citizens caught up in the event.\n",
      "The Prime Minister has said the National Security Committee was continuing to meet every few days to discuss the outbreak and would sit again on Friday.\n",
      "Further the Government is working closely with the states and territories and continue to do that to keep Australians safe,\n",
      "Mr Morrison says in his message to Australia that \"Australians to go about their business, to understand and listen to the advice that’s being received.”\n",
      "The World Organisation Health has held off declaring the outbreak a “pandemic of global significance”. According to the National Health Commission in China, where nearly 3,000 people have been infected and 81 have died.\n",
      "Coronavirus outbreak prompts warning for Australian GPs to wear masks during consultations Key points: China says the incubation period for the virus could range from one to 14 days The virus is infectious during incubation, unlike Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Schools and universities to remain closed in Beijing to contain the virus The median age of people with the virus is 57-years-old Early analysis suggests the virus was more likely to be fatal in people who suffered severe breathlessness Those who have the virus may unknowingly pass it on before symptoms show in the infected person It is thought to take between two and 14 days to see symptoms There is no test for the virus\n",
      "There were a total of 2,744 confirmed cases from 30 Chinese provinces and autonomous regions as of yesterday, with \"51 cured and discharged patients\", according to Chinese state-owned media.\n",
      "The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei province, including Wuhan city, climbed from 56 to 76 overnight, health commission officials said, with four deaths elsewhere in China.\n",
      "While a small number of cases have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, no fatalities have been reported elsewhere.\n",
      "Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said there was still no cause for concern for Australians at this stage.\n",
      "According to the experts, if you contract the new coronavirus, you can feel anything from being \"very, very, ill\" to just \"mildly unwell\". This is a snap shot of information you need to know about the Coronavirus What is Coronavirus?\n",
      "Coronavirus are a family of viruses that cause illnesses from the common cold to severe illnesses, typically they infect animals but a few affect humans like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MER-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The coronavirus currently causing concern is known as 2019-nCoV. It is a new strain that has not previously been identified in humans.\n",
      "Why is the virus concerning world wide health authorities?\n",
      "Some coronaviruses can have severe death tolls. The MER-coV virus has a fatality rate of 26 per cent, SARS had a fatality rate of 12 per cent. This compares to the fatality rate for the influenza virus of less than one per cent. To date the new 2019 nCoV coronavirus has killed nine people so it is so far not as severe as these more worrying coronaviruses.\n",
      "Symptoms of the virus?\n",
      "The symptoms could be as mild as a common cold but in severe cases it the virus can cause severe pneumonia, fever and shortness of breath.\n",
      "What is the origin of the virus?\n",
      "The virus originated in the city of Wuhan in China the first cases were identified in people who travelled to local food markets and one theory is it was transmitted from animals to some of the humans who visited the market.\n",
      "Is human to human transmission possible?\n",
      "Chinese health authorities have confirmed the virus is now being transmitted from human to human. A number of health workers in China contracted the virus from sick patients.\n",
      "How do you catch this virus?\n",
      "The virus could be transmitted in droplets in the breath of infected people or could be transmitted if they leave traces of the virus on door handles or railings they have touched that are subsequently touched by others.\n",
      "Protecting yourself?\n",
      "Wearing a face mask could help if the virus is transmitted through the air. Washing hands with soapy water regularly and using alcohol based hand disinfectants available in supermarkets can help prevent the spread.\n",
      "What do you do if you have flu like symptoms?\n",
      "If you have been in contact with anyone who has recently travelled to China or an infected country who has been ill you should go to your doctor and get tested. Stay at home and don’t use public transport to minimise spreading the infection.\n",
      "Is there a test for the coronavirus?\n",
      "The US has developed a fast test for the virus and is in the process of sharing it with other countries. Results can be returned within a day.\n",
      "Coronavirus incubation period?\n",
      "It could take between seven to 10 days after you are infected before symptoms of the virus emerge.\n",
      "Is there a vaccine ?\n",
      "Currently there is no vaccine but the National Institute of Health in the US is working on one. Also Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the University of Queensland has government funding for epidemic preparedness and may be asked to help develop a vaccine.. It could take months before it can be trialled.\n",

      "(CNN) In 2006, I worked at the Museum of Chinese in America (MoCA), in the historic building that went up in flames last Friday over the Lunar New Year. At the time, the museum had five staff and two volunteers; a small permanent exhibit was on the second floor. I held a temporary position, packaging historic menus for an exhibition titled \"Have You Eaten Yet?\"\n",
      "The exhibit traced the evolution of the Chinese restaurant in America, from a cuisine once despised by white Americans to one embraced nationwide. The menus were beautiful: richly colored, ornately decorated and full of fascinating details including purposefully misspelled words pandering to stereotypes (\"flied lice\" as opposed to \"fried rice\") and lyrics to Broadway show tunes. Jason Steinhauer Each evening after work, I would walk down the steps of the building on Mulberry Street, built in 1893, and into the heart of a bustling Chinatown at twilight. It was not lost on me that a museum dedicated to Chinese immigrants occupied an old school building in Little Italy, across from Christopher Columbus Park, basketball courts and in the shadows of City Hall. It was like standing at the crossroads of America each day. Thankfully, it appears the museum's artifacts are salvageable . Those artifacts include menus, books, magazines, theater programs, ticket stubs, photographs, scrapbooks, oral histories, passports, letters, paper fans, printing blocks, community flyers and much more. They are crucial because our fellow Americans of Chinese origin and with Chinese heritage are an important part of our ever-unfolding American story -- even if we have not always treated them as such. A new virus stirs up ancient hatred The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 denied entry to Chinese laborers, despite being less than 5% of admitted immigrants at the time. Chinese women were specifically barred, those who did arrive often sold into prostitution. Male laborers often worked for low wages and suffered from family separation, ill health and drug addiction. Chinese workers were subjected to \"harassment, robberies, and mob violence\" writes historian Erika Lee in her book \"The Making of Asian America.\" Read More In New York, Chinese American shopkeepers, peddlers and laborers formed a small enclave in Lower Manhattan. In the 20th century, as immigration quotas were lifted, Chinatown grew from a few thousand residents into a bustling epicenter of New York life and the largest Chinatown in the nation (by population). It was that rapid change that prompted the Chinatown History Project in 1980. Community members and activists salvaged photographs, scrapbooks and ephemera from dumpsters and curbsides in an attempt to comprehend how quickly things had changed. The seeds of that project would become the Chinatown History Museum, renamed to the Museum of Chinese in the Americas, and, today, called the Museum of Chinese in America. Fire devastates New York museum of Chinese American life The MoCA collections are not solely evidence of why immigrants left China; they are evidence of why they remained in America. In China, there was often political upheaval, war, starvation and mass killings during the Cultural Revolution . In America, despite obstacles and discrimination, there were possibilities for independence, financial security, and communion. Those promises -- cliché though they may sound -- have brought millions of Chinese immigrants to these shores, as they have so many other immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Today, Chinese Americans continue to face discrimination: diplomats subject to assignment restrictions ; scientists wrongly accused of espionage; intelligence and military personnel stripped of security clearances ; and researchers purged from cancer projects. In the wake of the coronavirus, Chinese Americans have witnessed viral videos and Internet memes degrading their culture and cuisine, in addition to constant attacks against their ancestral homeland by western pundits.

      "Those tempted to see our fellow American citizens of Chinese heritage as somehow \"lesser than\" might benefit from a visit to MoCA. Though the museum documents local stories, the stories have national and transnational reverberations. They illustrate poignantly the changes to American society that dynamically occur around us each day. To quote historian David A. Gerber, American history is a collection of \"individuals alternately suffering and enjoying the emancipating processes of freedom and choice.\" America is continually reinvented by those who make it home, a process we should not fear but rather embrace. We should be thankful that the MoCA collections survived. They are a reminder that though we may have vast cultural differences across vast geographies, all of us play a role in the formation of the American story.\n",

(Photo Credit: Sgt. Natalie Kintz (Tripler AMC)) VIEW ORIGINAL HONOLULU- Tripler Army Medical Center's highly infectious disease of significance team held an exercise last week at Tripler to test communication and utilization of personal protective equipment for respiratory pathogens such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.\"It was an opportunity for us to implement a rapid triage, starting at the entry point where the patient comes in, to the time the person is actually discharged from the hospital,\" said Iwalani Sato, Hawaii Military Health System's medical disaster planning working group liaison. The highly infectious disease of significance, HIDoS, drill prepares the facility and all essential communications for a medical surge or possible pandemic according to Sato. The drill was executed positively because the operations plan created by Kevin Guerrero, TAMC's Provost Marshal, and unites the public health executive officer and emergency management personnel to expedite actions and decisions on the ground level. Other central activation members involved were the Hawaii MHS, and Tripler's intensive care unit, emergency department, lab, infection control, Provost Marshal Office, and preventative medicine, as well as Hawaii's Department of Health. \"What makes this drill so incredibly relevant is that we had this scenario where the patient was a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, patient which is a coronavirus,\" said Mary Ono, Assistant PHEO and Army family physician. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, MERS-CoV is a respiratory virus with an unidentified source that is currently being investigated. The virus spreads from person-to-person, similarly to MERS that arose in 2012\"We were validating the quick identification and isolation of a HIDoS patient and the proper donning and doffing of the personal protective equipment throughout the staff,\" said Ono. \"Even the receptionist was aware that this patient was quite ill and coughing with fever and immediately gave them a mask, which is the appropriate thing to do. The charge nurse put the patient in a negative pressure room, which is exactly what we would like to see,\" said Ono. Army Capt. Joshua Callaway, the emergency department's charge nurse coordinated the communication and directed the appropriate staff to where they needed to be according to Army Capt. Aaron Matthews, emergency department clinical nurse specialist, . \"It was a good test of communication and the response from the system,\" said Matthews. During the exercise, the patient was moved from the emergency department to the intensive care unit. \"The ICU was fantastic receiving the patient. Everyone donning and doffing appropriately,\" said Ono. \"The exercise was a success,\" said Ono. \"Both units, despite all the equipment in-between, they were very calm and reassuring to the patient that it was going to be OK and they were going to take good care of them and that was nice to watch.\" Recommendations from the CDC to minimize risk of infection are suggested for those traveling to practice safe hand hygiene and stay away from sick individuals.

      "Published 7:42 pm EST, Thursday, January 30, 2020 WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump, a leading critic of the Obama White House's handling of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, is under increasing political pressure to mount a coordinated federal response to the threat of the new strain of coronavirus - amid fears of a global health crisis with economic ramifications in an election year.\n",
      "The White House has sought to tamp down criticism from Democrats in recent days by projecting an air of confidence and competence, with Trump presiding late Wednesday over an interagency briefing in the Situation Room. He also announced a new task force of senior aides to lead the government's response, including screenings at 20 U.S. airports, the repatriation of U.S. citizens from China and efforts to develop a potential vaccine to treat the novel virus.\n",
      "The disease, dubbed a \"public health emergency\" by the World Health Organization, has infected more than 9,000 people in China and Taiwan, along with about 100 confirmed cases outside that country, including six people in the United States.\n",
      "\"This is no cause for urgent panic in any way in the United States,\" Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of health, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. \"This is currently under control. But really, this is a dynamic and rapidly changing event, and the news can change at any moment. But the resources are deployed, the government is mobilized and we feel confident - we know the right steps to take to contain it.\"\n",
      "Yet the vast uncertainty over the contagiousness and lethality of the coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and the complicated geopolitics given Beijing's poor record of transparency in handling infectious diseases, have increased the stakes for the Trump administration. So has the president's interest in an election year of restoring more normal trade relations with China after years of tariff battles.\n",
      "Democrats, including 2020 presidential candidates Joe Biden, the former vice president, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have warned that the president's policies have made the United States more vulnerable to an infectious disease crisis.\n",
      "They pointed to the dismantling of a global health security team in 2018 during a reorganization of the White House's National Security Council. And in an opinion article published in USA Today on Monday, Biden called Trump the \"worst possible leader\" to oversee the government's response, citing his call for then-President Barack Obama to implement a travel ban on West African countries during the Ebola crisis even though public health experts opposed such a move.\n",
      "\"I remember how Trump sought to stoke fear and stigma . . . He called President Barack Obama a 'dope' and 'incompetent' and railed against the evidence-based response our administration put in place,\" Biden wrote.\n",
      "Trump has been uncharacteristically muted on the coronavirus. On Wednesday, he tweeted out photos of his Situation Room briefing and professed that his administration is working closely with China. \"We have the best experts anywhere in the world, and they are on top of it 24/7!\" he wrote.\n",
      "One senior administration official said Trump has been hesitant to speak out because some aides have cautioned that he could unnecessarily cause public alarm - and assured him that China is working hard to keep the virus under control. But increasingly, there is a feeling among aides that the president must say more, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n",
      "Heath and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who is leading the new task force, provided Trump with a briefing on China's response that prompted the president to issue a more positive tweet last week about Beijing's performance than other officials, including Joseph Grogan, director of the White House's Domestic Policy Council, believed was warranted, the senior aide said.\n",
      "This week, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney began holding daily meetings focused on the issue, officials said, and aides have begun discussing how they could safely evacuate people from China, along with where they could be placed in the United States.\n",
      "Some administration officials and members of Congress have expressed concern over how transparent Beijing has been in accounting for the breadth of the virus and its failure so far to share full data with the United States and other countries.\n",
      "Meanwhile, some U.S. lawmakers have pressed for a targeted travel ban from China, which Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Okla., a close White House ally, said in a letter to the administration was \"warranted to protect Americans until we know more about the virus and the outbreak is under control.\"\n",
      "Trump's 2020 campaign countered Biden's criticism by pointing to remarks he made in April 2009 during an outbreak of swine flu that he would counsel his own family not to ride the subway or airplanes, which a White House spokesman later said might have caused people to be \"unduly alarmed.\"\n",
      "\"This is another attempt by a failing candidate to gain credibility on an issue where he has almost none,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said of Biden.\n",
      "Experts said the new coronavirus appears to be more contagious but far less deadly than Ebola, which is thought to have infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 during the 2014 outbreak. But China already has confirmed more cases of coronavirus than of SARS, a more deadly coronavirus, during an outbreak that spread through Asia in 2002 and 2003.\n",
      "As the midterm elections approached in fall 2014, Trump and numerous GOP leaders faulted Obama for his response to Ebola. Obama appointed Ron Klain, a Democratic political operative, as the administration's Ebola czar.\n",
      "All told, four people in the United States were found to have contracted the disease, including a Liberian national who died while visiting Dallas. The other three recovered, and Obama declared a qualified victory in early 2015 during an event at the White House with public health professionals.\n",
      "In an essay in The Atlantic on Thursday, Klain said Trump's 2014 criticism amounted to a \"virulent, xenophobic, fearmongering outburst.\" He cited a study from the Obama White House's Office of Digital Strategy that concluded Trump's tweets were a driving factor in instilling a sense of unfounded fear over Ebola among the American public.\n",
      "Trump \"will have to trust the kind of government experts he has disdained to date, set aside his own terrible instincts, lead from the White House, and work closely with foreign leaders and global institutions - all things he has failed to do in his first 1,200 days in office,\" wrote Klain, who is advising Biden's campaign.\n",
      "Some global health security experts said that a more senior White House official should be in charge of the Trump administration's response given that Azar has little authority over other agencies. Critics pointed to the 2018 restructuring at the NSC that led to the departure of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, who had overseen a team dedicated to the U.S. response to a deadly pandemic, as weakening the senior-level attention.\n",
      "\"This is much bigger than HHS,\" said Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"There's a sluggishness built into the system by the way they have structured themselves.\"\n",
      "But Tim Morrison, who served on the NSC from 2018-2019, said Ziemer's team was merged with another NSC department and that experts remain on the White House staff. He cited the administration's handling of an Ebola outbreak in the Congo in 2018 as evidence that the White House remains capable of coordinating an effective response to an international threat.\n",
      "White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien and his deputy, Matthew Pottinger, a fluent Mandarin speaker, are also on the president's task force. Vice President Mike Pence has been involved in interagency meetings.\n",
      "\"I think the administration is actually running a very effective process,\" said Morrison, now a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. \"They don't need an Ebola czar the way the Obama administration needed one. They've got the apparatus in place.\"\n",
      "On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have been in touch with Azar and other senior administration officials, and Democrats have mostly refrained from overt criticism of Trump, even as they pressed the administration to devote sufficient resources to managing the situation.\n",
      "\"A global pandemic is like a meteor coming out of the sky,\" said a Democratic congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n",
      "The White House \"recognizes the risk of the appearance of not being on top of the situation in case it does turn out this is worse or more problematic than it initially appears,\" the aide added. \"There's very little political price you pay for overreacting because people will forget. There's a huge potential vulnerability for underreacting.\"\n",

      "The State Department is urging Americans not to travel to China amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed 170 people in China and infected thousands worldwide.\n",
      "The State Department announced Thursday evening that it had elevated its travel advisory to the highest level after the World Health Organization declared the viral outbreak an international public health emergency earlier Thursday.\n",
      "The advisory instructs those in China to consider leaving by commercial travel, adding that the department \"has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus.\" ADVERTISEMENT The department warns in the advisory that travelers on commercial carriers may face restrictions with little to no notice, noting that several commercial carriers have limited or suspended travel to and from China. The State Department ordered all non-emergency U.S. government personnel and their family members to evacuate from Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, last week. It said it has limited ability to provide services to U.S. citizens in the Hubei province where Wuhan is located. A majority of the 7,834 confirmed coronavirus cases are in China, and the disease has caused nearly 200 deaths thus far. The coronavirus has spread to 18 other countries through 98 other cases, including incidents of human-to-human contraction in Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the U.S. The U.S. reported its its sixth case but first human-to-human transmission Thursday in Chicago, with a patient contracting the virus from his spouse. Airlines like Delta, United and American Airlines have all been decreasing the number of flights between U.S. and China throughout the week. The first congressional hearing on the virus is scheduled for next week in a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee.\n",

      "Were you born in an H1N1 year or an H3N2 year? The first type of influenza virus we are exposed to in early childhood dictates our ability to fight the flu for the rest of our lives, according to a new study from a team of infectious disease researchers at McMaster University and Université de Montréal.\n",
      "The findings, published this week in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases , provide compelling new evidence to support the phenomenon known as ‘antigenic imprinting’, which suggests that early exposure to one of the two flu strains that circulate every year imprints itself on our immunity and disproportionately affects the body’s lifelong response to the flu.\n",
      "This could have important implications for pandemic and epidemic planning, allowing public health officials to assess who might be at greater risk in any given year, based on their age and what viruses were dominant at the time of their birth.\n",
      "“People’s prior immunity to viruses like flu, or even coronavirus, can have a tremendous impact on their risk of becoming ill during subsequent epidemics and pandemics,” says Matthew Miller, a co-author on the study and an associate professor at the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease and the McMaster Immunology Research Centre.\n",
      "“Understanding how their prior immunity either leaves them protected or susceptible is really important for helping us to identify the populations who are most at risk during seasonal epidemics and new outbreaks,” he says.\n",
      "Researchers collected and analyzed data from the 2018-19 flu season, which was highly unusual because both strains of influenza A dominated at different periods of time. Typically, only one strain dominates each flu season and will account for almost all cases.\n",
      "The researchers found that people who were born when H1N1 was dominant have a much lower susceptibility to influenza during seasons dominated by that virus than during seasons dominated by H3N2. In turn, those born in a H3N2 year are less vulnerable to influenza A during seasons dominated by H3N2.\n",
      "“We already knew from our previous studies that susceptibility to specific influenza subtypes could be associated with year of birth. This new study goes much further in support of antigenic imprinting. Instead of just showing how specific age patterns are associated with one subtype or the other during a single influenza season, we took advantage of a unique ‘natural experiment’ to show how the change in subtype dominance during one season appears to lead, practically in real time, to a change in susceptibility by age,” explained Alain Gagnon, professor of demography at the University of Montreal and lead author of the study.\n",
      "Health Canada estimates that influenza causes approximately 12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths every year.\n",
      "Researchers hope to further explore transmission dynamics by analyzing how viruses spread within households, where exposure is high and prolonged. In this environment, they can assess how imprinting may or may not affect the transmission of each strain. ###\n",

      "Tweet: 1 hour ago Technology VOA Sci & Tech 26 The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak that has spread from China to 18 other countries a global health emergency. Thursday’s announcement from Geneva means the WHO regards the outbreak as an \"extraordinary event\" needing a coordinated international response. Experts say there is evidence of people-to-people transmission of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control Thursday reported the first case of human transmission in the United States. Doctors say a Chicago man caught the virus from his wife who had been in Wuhan. He is the sixth confirmed coronavirus case in the United States. A woman, who declined to give her name, wears a mask, Jan. 30, 2020, in New York. She works for a pharmaceutical company and said she wears the mask out of concern for the coronavirus. India and the Philippines announced their first confirmed cases Thursday, joining a growing list that includes Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. China says as of Thursday, there are 7,800 cases in China and 170 deaths. The United States has evacuated more than 200 people from Wuhan. Several other countries have also evacuated their nationals and some international airlines have suspended direct flights to China. U.S. President Donald Trump was briefed on the outbreak by those he calls the \"great agencies\" working with China. \"We will continue to monitor the ongoing developments. We have the best experts anywhere in the world and they are on top of it 24/7,\" he tweeted late Wednesday. Paramilitary officers wearing masks line up in front of the Tiananmen Gate, as China is hit by an epidemic of the new coronavirus, in Beijing, Jan. 30, 2020. The White House has said it is considering further restrictions on U.S. airlines flying to China, in addition to the voluntary restrictions by some air carriers. It has not yet decided whether to impose a travel ban. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said none of the 195 American passengers evacuated Wednesday from Wuhan show symptoms of coronavirus. They will remain at a U.S. military base in California at least through the end of the week. The CDC said the risk to Americans is low and that it is working with the WHO to get a U.S. team to China as soon as possible. The CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier says the symptoms of a cold or the flu and the coronavirus are the same, but the risk factors are having visited China's Hubei province or having close contact with those who have been there.\n",

      "RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) \" Jarred Evans, a professional football player in China, is used to wearing a helmet and shoulder pads. But in the wake of a deadly viral outbreak, he's switched to a mask and medical gloves.\n",
      "'When you're dealing with life and death, it's a whole different ball game,\" he said in a telephone interview Thursday.\n",
      "Evans, 27, was one of 195 Americans evacuated from the city of Wuhan and flown to March Air Reserve Base in Southern California until authorities confirm they don't have the coronavirus that has sickened thousands and killed more than 170 people.\n",
      "Most cases are in China, but the outbreak has spread to more than a dozen countries, and the World Health Organization declared a global emergency Thursday.\n",
      "The U.S. on Thursday confirmed the country's first case of person-to-person spread of the virus, a man who is married to a Chicago woman in her 60s who got sick after she returned from a trip to Wuhan.\n",
      "Evans and the other evacuees, including children ranging from around a year old to about 13, are staying at the sprawling base where they received a battery of blood tests and were given nose, throat and mouth swabs, Evans said. Some test results won't be back for a week, he added.\n",
      "While the surroundings are fairly comfortable, Evans said Thursday that he and others are still being cautious about mingling.\n",
      "'I'm still wearing my mask and I'm still wearing my gloves,\" he said in a telephone interview. 'We're still not knowing who has it. I'm still taking major precautions. You don't know whether you're in the clear.'\n",
      "'Today a lot of kids were enjoying the weather,' he said, and the base provided scooters, bikes, footballs and soccer balls for them to play with.\n",
      "But at dinnertime, Evans added, 'everyone's getting their food and going right back to their rooms.'\n",
      "Those being held at the base 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Los Angeles arrived Wednesday morning. They aren't required to stay but had agreed to remain for at least 72 hours. Officials also can quarantine any of those evacuated on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "That happened to another American who tried to leave Wednesday night.\n",
      "Officials in Riverside County ordered the person quarantined for two weeks unless medically cleared sooner, said Jose Arballo Jr., a spokesman for the county's public health agency.\n",
      "The order was issued 'as a result of the unknown risk to the public\" because the person had not undergone a complete health evaluation, the agency said.\n",
      "It can take up to 14 days for someone who is infected to develop symptoms, health officials believe. None of the Americans housed at base have shown symptoms of the virus since their arrival, Arballo said.\n",
      "Evans said he would remain until testing shows he is free of the virus.\n",
      "He is a professional quarterback who moved to Wuhan several years ago to play in a Chinese football league.\n",
      "The city of 11 million people felt joyful, he said, with residents getting ready for the Lunar New Year.\n",
      "Then, in a matter of days, 'it turned into chaos\" as news broke of the rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak. Suddenly, Evans said, people were swarming pharmacies and stores to get masks and disinfectant spray.\n",
      "Friends translated the news for Evans, who speaks no Chinese.\n",
      "'I stocked up on rice, noodles, water, anything that could help me survive for a week or two,' Evans said.\n",
      "The Chinese government shut down the city. Buses, trains, taxis, and personal cars were banned. The military patrolled some streets.\n",
      "'That's when people, honestly, stayed locked in their homes,' Evans said.\n",
      "He compared the deserted city to an Old West ghost town.\n",
      "'I've never experienced anything like this before,\" he said. 'Imagine new York city being shut down. I was completely scared at first, because I didn't know exactly what was going to happen. I don't speak the language, and my family is so far away.'\n",
      "Evans holed up in his home for a week and a half until he received the news that the U.S. Embassy was evacuating its diplomats and their families and other U.S. citizens.\n",
      "He was notified that a chartered flight was carrying some of the 1,000 or so Americans in Wuhan back to the United States. The flight was coming in the next day.\n",
      "Evans said he was told, 'If you can make it there, you're on the flight.'\n",
      "'It was a race against time,\" he said.\n",
      "Evans found an acquaintance who drove him to the airport. The embassy notified Chinese authorities of the license plate number so he could pass through the guarded streets.\n",
      "Evans said he was No. 171 out of 195 people permitted on board.\n",
      "On the plane were two men in full hazardous material suits, who warned them about the seriousness of the outbreak. Nobody appeared sick but all of the passengers decided to wear masks throughout the flight, Evans said.\n",
      "The plane flew to Anchorage, where the passengers had health screenings, and then landed at March Reserve Air Base on Wednesday morning. The U.S. arrival was joyful, Evans said.\n",
      "'We were clapping, smiling, laughing ... there were cheers,' he said.\n",
      "Once he is cleared, Evans intends to visit his family. Then it's on to Switzerland, where is signed to play with the Bern Grizzlies this year. But he would like to return to Wuhan when the coronavirus outbreak recedes.\n",

      "BEIJING (AP) — The U.S. advised against all travel to China as the number of cases of a worrying new virus spiked more than tenfold in a week, including the highest death toll in a 24-hour period reported Friday.\n",
      "The virus has infected almost 10,000 people globally in just two months, a worrying sign of its spread among people that prompted the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a global emergency.\n",
      "The State Department's travel advisory told Americans currently in China to consider departing using commercial means, and requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel in light of the virus.\n",
      "China as of Friday morning counted 9,692 confirmed cases with a death toll of 213, including 43 new fatalities. The vast majority of the cases have been in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan, where the first illnesses were detected in December. No deaths have been reported outside China.\n",
      "The National Health Commission reported 596 cases have been \"cured and discharged from hospital.\" WHO noted most people who got the illness had milder cases, though 20% experienced severe symptoms. Symptoms of the new coronavirus include fever and cough and in severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.\n",
      "Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry said it will send charter flights to bring home residents of Hubei from overseas. It gave few details, but said those from Hubei and especially Wuhan would be sent directly back as soon as possible in light of the “practical difficulties\" they were encountering.\n",
      "China has placed more than 50 million people in the region under virtual quarantine, while foreign countries, companies and airlines have cut back severely on travel to China and quarantined those who recently passed through Wuhan. The virus is believed to have a two-week incubation period, during which those infected can pass on the illness even if they show no symptoms such as fever and cough.\n",
      "Since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December, 18 countries have reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.\n",
      "Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and WHO noted with its emergency declaration Thursday it was especially concerned that some cases abroad also involved human-to-human transmission. It defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.\n",
      "“The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. “Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.\n",
      "“This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China,\" he said. “On the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak.\"\n",
      "A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.\n",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said it was authorizing the departure of family members and all non-emergency U.S. government employees from Beijing and the consulates in the cities of Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang. Staff from the Wuhan consulate departed earlier this week.\n",
      "The decision was made “out of an abundance of caution related to logistical disruptions stemming from restricted transportation and availability of appropriate health care related to the novel coronavirus,\" the embassy said.\n",
      "The level 4 “Do Not Travel\" advisory is the highest grade of warning.\n",
      "Mike Wester, a businessman in Beijing who has lived in China for 19 years, said he has no plans to leave.\n",
      "“I feel safer self-quarantining myself here at home than I do risking travel,” said Wester.\n",
      "He pointed to potential risks from crowds at airports and being required to remove a mask for passport and security checks.\n",
      "Speaking by Skype from Utah, Kelly Flanagan, 36, a school counselor in China since 2011, said she is planning to stay out of China as she watches the virus spread.\n",
      "“This is probably going to be awhile,” said Flanagan, who said her Type 1 diabetes added to her health concerns. From the U.S. she is working remotely with her students to help them pass English proficiency exams.\n",
      "Japan and Germany also advised against non-essential travel and Britain did as well, except for Hong Kong and Macao.\n",
      "Tedros said WHO was not recommending limiting travel or trade to China, where transport links have shut down in places and businesses including Starbucks and McDonald's temporarily closing hundreds of shops.\n",
      "“There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,” he said. He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders.\n",
      "China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said Thursday evening in New York that “we are still at a very critical stage in fighting the coronavirus” but stressed that the epidemic is still mainly confined to China and urged the international community against any overreaction.\n",
      "He said China appreciated “the friendly gesture made by the international community” in providing medical equipment, and “what are needed urgently,” especially in Hubei province, are masks and other protective medical supplies including glasses.\n",
      "Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact, like within families, the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus is worrying.\n",
      "In Japan, a tour guide and bus driver became infected after escorting two tour groups from Wuhan. In Germany, five employees of German auto parts supplier Webasto became ill after a Chinese colleague visited. The woman had shown no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to China.\n",
      "“That’s the kind of transmission chain that we don’t want to see,” said Marion Koopmans, an infectious diseases specialist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a member of WHO’s emergency committee.\n",

      "Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul will today propose to the government to consider suspending granting of visa on arrival for Chinese tourists to tighten control to fend off possible spread of coronavirus.\n",
      "The proposal comes hot on the heels of the World Health Organization’s declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.\n",
      "The minister, in his capacity as head of an ad hoc committee tasked with handling the health threat, dismissed as a fake news reports in some local media that as many as five million people from Wuhan have visited Thailand during the Chinese New Year festival. He insisted that only about 20,000 Chinese from Wuhan city had entered Thailand during the period.\n",
      "He said that arrivals from China have already dropped in number, while the screening process for all passengers arriving from China has been tightened, with special gates for their flights and a separate arrival pathway, where passengers from those flights are subjected to three screening checkpoints.\n",
      "Minister Anutin stressed that the Thai government is treating the health safety of the Thai people as its top priority.\n",
      "He disclosed that the number of Chinese tourists in Thailand has dropped by about 80%, while new arrivals have also fallen sharply, noting each flight arriving from China now carries about 30 tourists compared to the normal average rate of about 200.\n",
      "He also warned the public to keep abreast of news updates about the virus from the ministry and to be careful to avoid fake news.\n",

      "On Dec. 31, China alerted the World Health Organization that it had detected a pneumonia-like illness in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China’s Hubei province.\n",
      "By Jan. 7 the cause was identified as a novel coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, which is in the same family as the common cold and SARS. Two days later the Chinese Center for Disease Control had sequenced the entire genome of the virus, a rapidly achieved feat that will help scientists around the world more fully understand it.\n",
      "A medical team from 51 medical institutions in Shaanxi leaves Xi’an for Wuhan.\n",
      "For comparison, during the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, it took scientists two months to completely sequence that virus’s genome.\n",
      "Data from Chinese scientists have been published in international medical journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet, as well as in the domestic journal China Science Life Sciences.\n",
      "China’s response to the outbreak has been swift and massive. In cooperation with WHO and the international scientific community, it is taking this outbreak very seriously.\n",
      "“Party committees and governments at all levels must take novel coronavirus outbreak prevention and control as the top priority of their work,” said President Xi Jinping at a Jan. 25 meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, which set up a high-level task force to combat the virus. Led by Premier Li Keqiang, the task force arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 26 to coordinate efforts to contain the outbreak. As of Jan. 27, the Ministry of Finance has allocated $8.74 billion to combat the virus.\n",
      "Wuhan and several other cities have been put under partial quarantine, shutting down public transit and restricting travel by private cars, even as Chinese New Year/Spring Festival celebrations kicked off what is the largest annual human migration in the world.\n",
      "This is an unprecedented response to a viral outbreak. Free-market capitalist countries have been inhibited from taking similar measures because of how greatly such a move would disrupt their markets and profits.\n",
      "Huge government effort to contain the virus\n",
      "The Spring Festival holiday will be extended, with schools and many public facilities remaining closed, to slow the spread of the virus. The China Banking and Regulatory Commission announced it is freezing payment obligations on mortgages, loans and credit cards for those who do not have an income due to the outbreak. This is unheard of in Western capitalist countries, where every flu season many are forced to go to work sick or face deep debts and even homelessness.\n",
      "Over a thousand civilian medical workers have been sent to Wuhan from around the country, along with hundreds of medics from the People’s Liberation Army. Another 12 teams with more than 1,600 medical workers are preparing to go there. As a whole in Hubei province, over half a million medical workers have been mobilized for epidemic prevention, control and treatment of patients.\n",
      "The government plans to complete two entirely new hospitals in six to seven days to deal with patients, beating a previous record set in Beijing during the 2003 SARS outbreak. Using prefabricated buildings and an army of workers — who are being paid three times the usual wage — the Leishenshan Hospital will have nearly 1,500 beds, while the Huoshenshan hospital will have up to 1,000 beds.\n",
      "The two new hospitals are being built by state-owned firms and financed by China’s public banking system, allowing for a swift and coordinated response that can focus on meeting the public’s needs instead of extracting short-term profits. Unlike capitalist companies, state-owned firms can operate at a loss.\n",
      "State-owned Telecom China Mobile has set up a special 5G network in a Wuhan hospital to facilitate telemedicine, which will reduce exposure of medical workers to the virus. Factories have been ordered to massively increase production of medical supplies, like masks and gloves, after some shortages of these items were initially reported. Prices for these items spiked, but e-commerce giant Alibaba announced it would work to eliminate price hikes.\n",
      "Two very different responses\n",
      "No response to an outbreak like this will be perfect, but on-the-ground reports attest to the efficiency and seriousness with which it is being handled. This reporter spoke with Victoria Sinclair, a U.S. citizen living in the city of Dalian in northwest China. She said, “I’ve always been impressed with how quickly Chinese construction workers manage to work. Our highway was done in a few weeks, and I have no doubt the new hospitals they are building in Wuhan will be done quickly.” Sinclair added, “The buses and subway are still running in our city, but they [workers] are taking extra precautions and sanitizing them twice daily.”\n",
      "Coverage in the Western media has been largely negative, portraying China’s response as inept and lacking transparency, despite the central government calling on all cases of the virus to be immediately reported and several local officials in Wuhan facing repercussions for not acting swiftly enough. That doesn’t sound like the central government is trying to cover up the outbreak; yet it has been a major talking point in Western reporting.\n",
      "Despite the rapid and massive measures China has taken — only possible in a country with large amounts of public ownership, economic planning and leadership of the Communist Party — the Western media seem largely devoted to only criticizing China.\n",
      "It should be remembered that the Reagan administration not only ignored the AIDS crisis in the 1980s but mocked and ridiculed the tens of thousands of people dying from that deadly disease. And during the 2017-18 flu season in the U.S., more than 60,000 people died — a fact rarely mentioned — which puts China’s current outbreak into perspective.\n",
      "The current U.S. flu season has already seen over 6,000 fatalities, presenting a much greater threat at present to public health than the coronavirus. Yet the Western corporate media, driven by an endless need for more viewers and more advertising revenue, choose to put forward a sensationalist narrative regarding China — to grab people’s attention and generate more clicks.\n",
      "Resurgence of diseases in U.S.\n",
      "There has been a resurgence in the U.S. of leprosy and typhus in Los Angeles’s homeless population and measles and mumps in unvaccinated people.\n",
      "The U.S. actually has a lower vaccination rate than the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, which has a much smaller population and economy so it can spend much less on health care. A 2016 study published by the National Institutes of Health investigated vaccination rates of children living below the poverty line in four states and found that 40 percent had not received a single dose of the vaccine for rotavirus. Before introduction in 2006, rotavirus caused 20 to 60 deaths a year among children and up to 70,000 hospitalizations.\n",
      "Racism is also apparent in how little concern Western reports seem to have for the well-being of non-Western people hit by a deadly viral outbreak. While the accidental burning of Notre Dame in Paris and the massive wildfires in Australia both brought out public displays of sympathy and huge donations from Western corporations and billionaires, China’s coronavirus outbreak has not garnered the same sympathy and support.\n",
      "This is the inevitable result of a new Cold War being waged against China as the imperialist West attempts to hold on to its position as the global power center.\n",

      "SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - The new coronavirus epidemic is likely to wreak havoc on China auto sales and production in the first quarter, but it is too early to push panic buttons as ground could be made up later in the year, industry executives said.\n",
      "Showroom traffic is expected to be sparse when extended Lunar New Year holidays end as much of the population is steering clear of public spaces, while output is set to plunge in the short-term.\n",
      "That is particularly true of Hubei province, the center of the outbreak, a major automotive industrial hub that accounts for nearly 9% of China's vehicle production and home to factories for many car makers including Dongfeng Motor Group < 0489.HK > and its partners Honda Motor <7267.T>, Renault SA and PSA .\n",
      "\"We expect (China) vehicle production to decline 3% for the full year, with production down 15% in the first quarter, including the extended new year shutdown,\" Joseph Massaro, CFO for auto technology supplier Aptiv , told an earnings conference call.\n",
      "But he said delayed production could be made up in the second quarter. \"We don't view this as a full year issue at the moment.\"\n",
      "Seeking to rein in the epidemic, which has killed more than 200 people with nearly 9,700 confirmed cases of infection in China, authorities have extended Lunar New Year holidays by three days to Feb. 2 although many areas and companies are telling workers not to come back before Feb. 10.\n",
      "Prior to the outbreak, forecasts for the world's largest auto market this year had ranged from mild sales growth to small declines after two painful years of contraction due to a slowing economy, the U.S.-China trade war and the chaotic introduction of new emission rules.\n",
      "Cui Dongshu, secretary general at the China Passenger Car Association, said his prediction for industry-wide sales growth of 1% this year now \"under some pressure\".\n",
      "The holiday extension has discouraged dealers from ordering new cars from manufacturers at the end of the month as is their usual practice, virtually guaranteeing a decline in wholesale auto sales figures for January.\n",
      "\"Although sales volumes in the first three weeks of January were okay, there was no 'sales sprint' at the end of the month. So it is inevitable that we will see a significant sales drop,\" Cui said in a blog post.\n",
      "The big unknown is, however, just how far the outbreak, which authorities have said they expect to peak in February, will ravage Chinese consumer spending.\n",
      "Industry officials and analysts agree car sales will be hit in the short-term but also say the impact might not be too bad over the whole year.\n",
      "The outbreak could even change the mindset of the Chinese consumer towards car ownership, given that many are suffering in areas where public transport has been suspended, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.\n",
      "\"It is hard to predict its impact in the longer term. Customers who do not have their own car might realize they need one which might help sales this year,\" he said.\n",
      "Automakers with plants in Hubei, particularly in its capital Wuhan, which has seen its transport links cut off as part of a lock down to curb the virus, will have the most work to do in rejigging production plans. Production delays can often be made up later with extra shifts on weekends and at night.\n",
      "Honda, which has three assembly plants in Wuhan with Dongfeng, said it was assessing how transport disruptions were affecting the supply of parts and that no decision had been made on when its factories will restart.\n",
      "PSA's venture with Dongfeng said in a statement it will extend the Lunar New Year holidays for its workers but has not decided on a precise date.\n",
      "Renault plans to adjust its Wuhan production plans in line with guidance from local authorities, a company representative said. A Dongfeng representative said the company's decision on when to resume work will depend on the situation of the virus outbreak.\n",

The vast majority of the cases have been in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan, where the first illnesses were detected in December. No deaths have been reported outside China.\n",
      "The National Health Commission reported 171 cases have been \"cured and discharged from hospital.\" WHO has said most people who got the illness had milder cases, though 20% experienced severe symptoms.

Infected people don't show symptoms immediately and may be able to pass on the virus before they appear sick.\n",
      "Since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December, at least 20 countries have reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.\n",
      "Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and WHO noted with its emergency declaration Thursday it was especially concerned that some cases abroad also involved human-to-human transmission. It defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.\n",

      "A \"wet market\" in Wuhan, China, is catching the blame as the probable source of the current coronavirus outbreak that's sweeping the globe.\n",
      "Patients who came down with disease at the end of December all had connections to the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan China. The complex of stalls selling live fish, meat and wild animals is known in the region as a \"wet market.\" Researchers believe the new virus probably mutated from a coronavirus common in animals and jumped over to humans in the Wuhan bazaar.\n",
      "I visited the Tai Po wet market in Hong Kong, and it's quite obvious why the term \"wet\" is used. Live fish in open tubs splash water all over the floor. The countertops of the stalls are red with blood as fish are gutted and filleted right in front of the customers' eyes. Live turtles and crustaceans climb over each other in boxes. Melting ice adds to the slush on the floor. There's lots of water, blood, fish scales and chicken guts. Things are wet.\n",
      "At the Tai Po market, a woman who runs a shellfish stall — she only wants to give her name as Mrs. Wong — says people blame wet markets for spreading disease. But she says that's not fair. Like just about everyone else in the market. Wong is wearing a surgical face mask because of the coronavirus outbreak. She's heard about the links between the wet market in Wuhan, China, and the coronavirus but doesn't think something like that would happen in Hong Kong.\n",
      "\"It's much cleaner in the Hong Kong markets. It's so different from what's happening in mainland China,\" she says. \"When I go to mainland China and I'm trying to eat something, I'm concerned about what's in the food.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, this kind of market is not just an Asian phenomenon. There are similar markets all over the world — places where fish, poultry and other animals are slaughtered and butchered right on the premises.\n",
      "But researchers of zoonotic diseases — diseases that jump from animals to humans – pinpoint the wet markets in mainland China as particularly problematic for several reasons. First, these markets often have many different kinds of animals – some wild, some domesticated but not necessarily native to that part of Asia. The stress of captivity in these chaotic markets weakens the animals' immune systems and creates an environment where viruses from different species can mingle, swap bits of their genetic code and spread from one species to another, according to biologist Kevin Olival , vice president for research at the EcoHealth Alliance. When that happens, occasionally a new strain of an animal virus gets a foothold in humans and an outbreak like this current coronavirus erupts.\n",
      "The Tai Po market in Hong Kong does have some live animals besides the seafood but the selection is rather boring compared to the exotic assortment of snakes, mammals and birds on offer in some markets in mainland China. They're known to sell animals such as Himalayan palm civets, raccoon dogs, wild boars and cobras.\n",
      "The only live birds in Tai Po are chickens, which are kept behind the butchered pork section of the market.\n",
      "Chan Shu Chung has been selling chicken here for more than 10 years. He says business is really good right now because the price of pork — his main competition — is through the roof. Pork is in short supply due to trade tensions between China and the U.S. and a recent bout of swine flu. A chicken for sale at the Tai Po market in Hong Kong. Customers say that buying chickens that are slaughtered on the spot makes them feel that they're getting meat from fresh, healthy birds. Jason Beaubien / NPR\n",
      "So people are buying more chicken. Customers can select a live bird from Chung's cages. Chung pulls them out by their feet, holds them upside down to show off their plump breasts. If the customer is happy with the bird, Chung puts a plastic tag with a number on the chicken's foot. He gives the customer a matching tag, sort of like a coat check. Fifteen minutes later the shopper can come back and pick up the chicken meat.\n",
      "Chung says he and his colleagues do their best to keep the area clean. They wash down the stalls regularly and disinfect the countertops to stop germs from spreading.\n",
      "Chung, however, is one of the few people in the market who is not wearing a face mask. Face masks have become so common in Hong Kong since the coronavirus outbreak started that pharmacies across the city are sold out of them.\n",
      "Chung says he isn't afraid of this new coronavirus. He always gets his annual flu shot so he believes he's protected against this new disease, even though scientists say the flu shot will not protect people against this new coronavirus.\n",
      "Chung adds confidently that he's even immune to SARS — for which there also is no commercially available vaccine.\n",
      "But he does keep his chicken stalls incredibly clean, which public health officials say is one important step in stopping the spread of diseases. So maybe he's on to something. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2020 WESM\n",

      "As coronavirus concerns increase in the U.S., many people are now wearing face masks in public areas. But do those masks do any good?\n",
      "From the streets of New York City to airports around the nation, we’re seeing more and more people donning face masks after a handful of cases of the new coronavirus landed in the U.S. Traveler Miguel Jimenez says, “I feel a little bit more safe having it. I know it's not 100%, but I think it would be unwise not to take any precaution I can.\"\n",
      "While it may make some people feel better to have them, the CDC says wearing a face mask to protect yourself from this new coronavirus is actually not recommended. “It is unnecessary.

      "That’s because there’s not much evidence that face masks benefit the general population. Dr. Frank Esper is a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at the Cleveland Clinic. He says it’s really the sick person that should wear a face mask. “If they are feeling like they have symptoms, we do ask them to put on a mask when they’re coming to waiting rooms, or the emergency department, or when they’re going into a public space. It helps prevent the spread of infection,” says Dr. Esper.\n",
      "In fact, face masks are not recommended even during the throes of the flu season. Experts say there are better steps to stay healthy. “Wearing a mask when you don’t have symptoms is not really that helpful. What is helpful though is washing your hands,” says Dr. Esper.\n",

      "How does this happen? Fake news, which tends to be most sensational and headline-grabbing, can create virtual bandwagons with every batch of retweets on Twitter ( TWTR ).\n",
      "According to a 2018 MIT study, false news is 70% more likely to be retweeted than true stories, which take nearly six times as long to reach 1,500 people as it does for false stories to reach the same number of people.\n",
      "“Twitter’s ‘cascades,’ or unbroken retweet chains, falsehoods reach a cascade depth of 10 about 20 times faster than facts.

      "USA Today outlined some of the social media hoaxes that have emerged about the virus, including that FEMA was proposing martial law to rein it in. As Donovan, the UBS chief economist noted, fear about the virus could cost the economy more than the disease itself.\n",
      "“The recent pneumonia virus is widely compared to SARS in 2003. The economic cost of a virus is generally from the fear of the disease, not the disease itself. Seventeen years ago social media was essentially non-existent. Social media today gives more opportunities to spread fear. That fear may lead to economic change, which may be costly. The biggest problem is that economists struggle to fight these risks,” Donovan wrote in his blog post.\n",
      "In response to misinformation about the coronavirus, Twitter has created a new search prompt to direct users to credible information about it.\n",
      "Meanwhile, social video app TikTok has been hosting several videos that spread misinformation and falsehoods about the coronavirus. This comes despite a policy change concerning misinformation that the platform announced earlier this month, according to a new report from Media Matters , a progressive nonprofit media watchdog. Some teens are even falsely claiming that they have the virus in order to gain traction and virality.\n",

      "Tweet: VERIFY VERIFY: Can the Wuhan coronavirus spread from surfaces? Health experts say the likelihood you get the new coronavirus without direct contact with someone who visited Wuhan is very low. Author: VERIFY, Jason Puckett (TEGNA), David Tregde, Terry Spry Jr. Published: 4:02 PM CST January 30, 2020 Updated: 4:02 PM CST January 30, 2020 While most Americans will not have contact with someone who recently visited Wuhan - or any other part of China - there’s still plenty of fear about becoming sick. As stories of the new strain of Wuhan coronavirus continue, many viewers have started reaching out to VERIFY about their travel concerns. The cases in the U.S. are low, but some have been wondering whether cramped airplanes and crowded stations increase risks? THE QUESTION Can you catch the new strain of Wuhan coronavirus from touching a surface a sick person touched? Can the virus survive long enough to make public places unsafe? What about mailed packages from regions with the virus? THE ANSWER According to the Centers for Disease Control, it’s very unlikely that you could get the new coronavirus from a surface. They explained that coronaviruses don’t survive long outside the body. While a person could carry the virus for a number of days or weeks - the virus can only survive on surfaces for a short period. The CDC estimates that the life span is “in the range of hours.” That also means the chances are even lower for things like shipped packages. An imported good has likely been packaged and gone through a number of different environments before it winds up at your door. The director of the CDC's Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said Monday that “there’s likely a very, very, very low, if any risk of spread from products or packaging that is shipped” from China. WHAT WE FOUND There’s no evidence that anyone in the United States has picked up the coronavirus from any means beyond direct contact with bodily fluids. The CDC are particularly warning about “respiratory droplets.” Respiratory droplets are essentially the result of coughing or sneezing. People expel those droplets containing the virus and others can be infected if it enters their body. Therefore, a sick person touching something doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll get the virus on it. If they coughed or sneezed into their hand and then touched it, that would get the virus on the object. Similarly, if they coughed and sneezed around the object without touching it and the droplets got on the object, it would still get the virus. The CDC doesn’t know exactly how long this coronavirus can survive in the environment. Past coronaviruses have survived in the environment in a range between a few hours to several days . This illustration provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in January 2020 shows the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). AP Even if you touch a surface with this virus still living on it, that doesn’t automatically make you sick. You have to touch your mouth, nose, or eyes before you wash your hands. If you touch a viral surface and then wash your hands immediately after without touching your face, it’s unlikely you’ll get the virus. When VERIFY reached out to the CDC, they said they can’t fully evaluate the risks from products that are shipped from affected areas, however there’s no evidence that supports transmission of this coronavirus is associated with imported goods. In a briefing with journalists on Monday , Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, addressed the question of packages specifically. She said, “In general, because of the poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, that’s in the range of hours, there’s likely a very, very, very low if any risk of spread from products or packaging that is shipped over a period of days or weeks in ambient temperatures.” The CDC said no cases in the United States are associated with imported goods. In fact, every case of the coronavirus in the United States before today was in a person who traveled through Wuhan. The only American patient who hasn’t visited Wuhan had regular close contact with a person who had been to Wuhan and whose infection was already confirmed. They also say to wash your hands with soap and water regularly and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. While the likelihood of an average American getting the virus is already low, doing that will keep your odds of catching the virus even lower.\n",

      "The announcement was made as more than 80 Britons on an evacuation flight from the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak landed back in the UK.\n",
      "The two patients are currently being treated by Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in its specialist Airborne High Consequences Infectious Disease Centre (HCID).\n",
      "It is understood that they travelled to the UK from China in recent days, had been staying at a hotel in Yorkshire, and are now undergoing treatment at the Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary.\n",
      "An outbreak investigation team has been formed to trace anyone who has been in contact with the pair to prevent onward transmission.\n",
      "Professor Sharon Peacock from Public Health England said anyone who has been in contact with the two patients in England should self-isolate for 14 days, and if they develop any symptoms they are advised to call 111 or their GP.\n",
      "She said while staff are currently working to trace people who have been in contact with the pair, they do not currently have “any idea” of how high that number might be. (PA Graphics)\n",

      "The PA news agency understands that the Foreign Office (FCO) is working with EU countries to add British passengers to any rescue flights they may charter back from Wuhan.\n",
      "After several delays, the evacuation flight left Wuhan at 9.45am local time on Friday, carrying 83 Britons and 27 non-UK nationals, mostly from EU countries.\n",
      "The flight arrived at the Brize Norton RAF base in Oxfordshire at around 1.30pm.\n",

      "Advertisement Loading The \"new information\" was not so serious that the tournament itself is under threat, with FFA sources insisting all matches will go ahead as per the amended program released earlier on Friday - including those involving the Chinese national team, who are being held in isolation at their Brisbane hotel until next week in line with the latest medical advice about the coronavirus.\n",
      "The events underline the sensitive and rapidly-changing nature of the landscape FFA is currently trying to negotiate, having taken on the hosting rights for the Tokyo 2020 qualifiers after China surrendered them in response to growing concerns about the spread of the deadly disease, which on Friday morning was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organisation.\n",
      "For FFA, the fact that tournament will be played is a welcome relief, because another dramatic turn of events threatened to undermine the late-night efforts of Johnson, chief operating officer Mark Falvo in putting together the new schedule, which has pushed back Australia's first game until Thursday.\n",
      "It took the cooperation of FIFA, the AFC, the Chinese Football Association and all of the clubs who the players involved represent to enable a fourth match day to be added, which will come after the official closure of the international window.\n",
      "China are to be in quarantine in Brisbane until Wednesday, which would be two weeks after they had left Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus outbreak began.\n",
      "Despite fears they would be restricted to their hotel for that entire time, FFA's background efforts have also yielded arrangements for them to be able to begin training before their first match on Thursday night against Thailand at Campbelltown Stadium.\n",
      "\"I'd like to thank the CFA for their understanding and cooperation, despite the difficult situation their team and staff have found themselves in since arriving in Brisbane,\" Jonhson said. \"FIFA, AFC and the clubs have also been extremely flexible and supportive of the changes to the match schedule.\n",
      "\"As always, the health of everyone involved, from players and officials to the fans and contractors, remains the number one priority. This new format allows us to stage these matches with that priority in mind and we now look forward to welcoming all teams and hosting a successful tournament.”\n",

Photo: AFP The world’s most populous country has become an increasing powerhouse in hosting international sport in recent years but has had its 2020 sporting calendar thrown into chaos. Here, AFP Sport lists the events already affected and those potentially under threat: Cancelled, postponed or moved - Football: China yesterday suspended all domestic football and postponed indefinitely the top-flight Chinese Super League season kick-off due on Feb 22 in order to “carry out prevention and control of the pneumonia epidemic,” said the Chinese Football Association. - Athletics: The World Indoor Championships, scheduled for Nanjing from March 13-15, were postponed for a year. “It is with regret that we have agreed with the organisers….to postpone the event to March 2021,” the sport’s governing body said in a statement Wednesday (Jan 29). - Football: The Asian Football Confederation announced Wednesday that home Champions League group stage games featuring four Chinese clubs would be switched to away fixtures for the first three match days in February and March. A decision on venues for each club’s three home group matches will be made at a later date. - Women’s football: A women’s Olympics qualifying event between China, Taiwan, Thailand and Australia scheduled from Feb 3-9 in Wuhan, the disease epicentre, was moved initially to Nanjing then to Sydney. The China women’s football team were quarantined in a Brisbane hotel on Wednesday after arriving in Australia for the tournament. - Boxing: A qualification event for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics initially scheduled from Feb 3-14 in Wuhan was rescheduled for Amman in Jordan from March 3-11. - Women’s basketball: Another Olympic qualifying tournament, a four-team battle for three Tokyo places between China, Great Britain, Spain and South Korea was moved on Monday (Jan 27) from Foshan, in southern China, to Belgrade where it will run alongside another four-team group on Feb 6-9. - Aquatics: The Chinese leg of the Diving World Series, scheduled for March 7-9 in Beijing, “has been cancelled,” Cornel Marculescu, president of the international swimming federation, told AFP on Monday. He said the World Series of synchronised swimming, scheduled for Suzhou from April 23-25, was also in question. - Cycling: The Tour of Hainan, due to be promoted to the second-tier ProSeries this year, was scheduled from Feb 23 to March 1 on the southern island of Hainan. It has been cancelled “due to the health situation in the country,” the International Cycling Union said on Monday but could be rescheduled later in 2020. - Golf: Yesterday the LPGA cancelled the 2020 Blue Bay LPGA scheduled for March 5-8 on Hainan Island because of concerns over the new coronavirus and travel restrictions implemented to slow its spread. “Given the current health concerns and significant travel restrictions put in place due to the coronavirus in China, the LPGA along with our partners in China have made the decision to cancel the 2020 Blue Bay LPGA,” the women’s tour said in a statement posted on its website. “Any time you cancel an event, it is a difficult decision and we appreciate how hard our title partner (Blue Bay), IMG, the China LPGA and the China Golf Association have worked to host an incredible event. “The health and safety of our players, fans and everyone working on the event is always our highest priority. While we are disappointed that the tournament won’t take place this season, we look forward to going back to Blue Bay in 2021 and for many years to come.” Under threat - Formula One: The Chinese Grand Prix race weekend is scheduled for Shanghai from April 17-19, an event which attracts tens of thousands of fans. “We are monitoring the situation in close collaboration with F1, the promoter and with the Federation of Automobile Sports in China, which is our conduit on the ground in China,” governing body FIA said in a statement. “We are all monitoring it together. At this stage not much we can do except watch the situation and react if necessary, if recommendations are made by the relevant authorities.” - Formula E: The electric car racing series is also due to stage a race in China, on March 21 on the southern island of Hainan. A Formula E statement read: “Given the current health concerns, we are continuing to closely monitor the situation as it develops on a daily basis. We have requested that our regional partner works together with the local motorsport federation, to liaise with the relevant authorities in Hainan province to further analyse and assess the situation and provide recommendations on preparations for the race.” - Football: China is due to host the Maldives in a World Cup qualifying match on March 26 and travel to Guam for another on March 31 and said despite the postponement of all domestic football any decision on international fixtures would be made at a later date. “The CFA will continue to maintain close communication with national authorities, and decide each event’s timing separately based on the actual development of the epidemic situation in each locality,” a statement said. - Wrestling: The Asian Olympic qualifying tournament scheduled for March 27-29 in Xi’an could be cancelled. “We are following the situation closely and we are in close contact with the Chinese federation and local authorities,” Nenad Lalovic, president of the International Wrestling Federation, told AFP on Monday. “We will take a decision within 15 days.” - Sport conference: The SportAccord annual convention, which brings together the presidents of the major international sports federations and the heads of the Olympic movement, including IOC President Thomas Bach, is due to take place in Beijing from April 19-24.

      "-Morgan Stanley, NAB economists push out timing of RBA rate cut -If coronavirus contagion extends beyond 3-4 months then global economy could be impacted -String of issues dominating telcos in 2020 -Major uncertainties overhang retail wealth managers -Two casinos in one location heralds margin risk\n",
      "By Eva Brocklehurst\n",
      "Rate Cuts\n",
      "Morgan Stanley is moving the timing of a cut to the Reserve Bank of Australia's cash rate to April from February, believing the February 4 meeting lacks a catalyst. The case remains strong for a reduction in 2020, perhaps two, as forward labour indicators suggest a softening over the first half.\n",
      "Yet, the December labour market data was strong and the consumer price index was broadly in line with forecasts. That said, Morgan Stanley is still confident the RBA will cut and envisages a second reduction could transpire in August. Moreover, the broker assesses there is scope for a weaker Australian dollar as the market is underpricing both the timing of the first rate cut and the risk of a second.\n",
      "National Australia Bank economists are also inclined to believe the RBA will stay its hand in February and use the recent improvement in the unemployment rate to buy time.\n",
      "The NAB economists expect a cut in April as well and a second one around mid year. By April it should be clear that private sector growth is flat, consumer spending is soft and the recent gains in employment will not be sustained. They expect the headwinds for consumption and business investment are likely to persist.\n",
      "Coronavirus\n",
      "Morgan Stanley observes the coronavirus has led to a suspension of economic activity and imposed pressures of both global and Chinese growth. The virus appears to be more contagious than SARS at its peak, with increased incidence of 790/day in the past five days.\n",
      "The Chinese authorities have imposed intercity travel restrictions and extended national holidays by three days. The most affected industries are travel, entertainment and retail , while extended factory suspensions could weigh on industrial production and trade.\n",
      "While there may be some adverse impact to first quarter global growth, the underlying drivers of a global recovery remain intact. If the situation extends beyond three or four months global growth could be further impacted.\n",
      "Citi assesses coronavirus is hitting the global economy at the worst possible time of year, as it has coincided with Chinese New Year. The broker estimates 20-27% of Chinese visitors to Sydney Airport ((SYD)) arrive during February and March.\n",
      "Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, has direct services to Sydney three times a week via China Eastern Airlines. The broker estimates the best case scenario for Sydney Airport is that the virus is contained in the near term and Chinese passenger numbers decline by -50% over February and March, affecting 2020 operating earnings (EBITDA) by less than -0.5%.\n",
      "A worst-case scenario could be a -5% decline in 2020 international passengers and this could affect operating earnings by -5-7% the broker assesses the potential impact on Auckland International Airport ((AIA)) is similar in a best case scenario but less severe in a bear case.\n",
      "Telecoms\n",
      "UBS notes two aspects of the National Broadband Network are being reviewed at the moment, including an inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) into access pricing and a parliamentary committee inquiry into the NBN business case.\n",
      "One of the issues relates to the NBN overbuilding existing RSP (retail service provider) fibre infrastructure and purportedly providing services directly to enterprise customers in contravention of its remit.\n",
      "The broker notes a concession has been proposed, whereby NBN will commence a consultation and instead of overbuilding existing RSP fibre run a process in which it would request one a more pre-qualified suppliers to provide dark fibre, or run a reverse auction process and allow existing fibre network providers to bid for the right to supply.\n",
      "UBS suggests this concession could be an incremental positive for RSP margins but makes no changes to forecasts. In the case of Vocus Group ((VOC)) NBN \"mission creep\" has little impact on near-term earnings and the existing customer base, while for Telstra ((TLS)) the broker remains comfortable with its estimate of the NBN gap being as large as $3.7bn.\n",
      "Goldman Sachs agrees several issues will dominate the 2020 outlook for Australasian telecoms. One will be the Federal Court decision on the proposed merger of TPG Telecom ((TPM)) and Vodafone Australia.\n",
      "The other issues include the outlook for mobiles, the earnings potential from a separation of Telstra's infrastructure business, and the NBN's corporate consultation. The broker has a Buy rating for Telstra, given its earnings trajectory on mobiles and an opportunity to still cut costs. There is also significant potential to crystallise value from the infrastructure.\n",
      "Goldman Sachs upgrades Vocus Group to Buy from Neutral, to reflect a positive earnings trajectory in enterprise and an improved operating environment.

      "Tweet: UM's latest study shows initiating mental health treatment is urgent and crucial for anti-epidemic campaign Universidade de Macau 2020-01-31 12:28 The novel coronavirus outbreak has received a lot of attention worldwide as the number of confirmed cases and deaths continue to climb and isolated cases are being reported abroad. In the meantime, mental health care for those affected by the outbreak, including confirmed coronavirus patients, suspected patients, quarantined family members, and medical personnel, has been under-addressed. A study conducted by the research team of Prof Xiang Yutao from the University of Macau (UM) Faculty of Health Sciences draws attention to this issue and has been recognised by the authoritative international journal Lancet Psychiatry . Titled ‘Timely Mental Health Care for the 2019-nCoV Outbreak is Urgently Needed’, the paper draws experience from global epidemic outbreaks in the past and discusses the importance of initiating mental health assessment, treatment, and interventions as part of the anti-epidemic campaign against the novel coronavirus outbreak. As of 30 January 2020, a total of 7,829 confirmed cases, 12,167 suspected cases, and 170 deaths were reported in mainland China. In the meantime, 84 confirmed cases have been reported abroad, while seven cases have been confirmed in Macao. During the epidemic outbreak, confirmed patients and suspected patients may worry about the grave consequences of this potentially deadly virus and experience a range of negative emotions such as feelings of helplessness, loneliness, and anger. In extreme cases, patients may even refuse treatment or commit violence or suicide. The physical symptoms experienced by these patients, such as fever, dyspnea, and cough, can also aggravate the above mental health problems. In addition, those who have been quarantined, including family members of the patients and close contacts, may worry about being discriminated by others and experience feelings of guilt. For frontline medical personnel, they usually experience more psychological problems because they are at a greater risk of catching the virus. The worry about catching the virus themselves and spreading it to their family members, friends, and colleagues can lead to severe anxiety and insomnia. Although these mental health problems are common among patients and their family members affected by the outbreak, most medical personnel working in isolation wards have never received professional training in psychiatry or clinical psychology and thus do not know how to handle them. According to the study, although the clinical features of the novel coronavirus is not identical to those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there are many similarities between the two in terms of the source of infection, epidemiological characteristics, the rapid form of transmission, and the inadequate preparations among health authorities for the outbreak. Part of the response plans adopted during the SARS outbreak in 2003 may help health officials head off some of the more serious consequences from this virus outbreak. Concrete suggestions include the following: First, local health authorities should form multidisciplinary (psychiatric and clinical psychological) teams comprised of psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, and clinical psychologists, in order to provide appropriate psychological interventions and support for patients, quarantined family members and close contacts, as well as frontline healthcare providers. For patients who have already developed severe mental disorders, psychiatric treatment should be provided immediately. Second, in order to reduce the feelings of uncertainty and fear about the epidemic among patients and medical personnel, the government and the media should release accurate and real-time information on the development of the epidemic to the general public. Meanwhile, the teams should closely monitor the infected patients and their family members to build their confidence in treatment. Also, remote online psychological counseling service can be provided through WeChat and other media platforms to patients and quarantined people to reduce their sense of isolation. Third, the teams should conduct regular mental health screening for depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts among infected patients, and provide timely intervention if necessary. Regarding the use of psychiatric drugs, the teams should prescribe based on the physical conditions of patients diagnosed with the 2019-nCoV pneumonia. They should also pay attention to the medication doses and the interactions between different drugs. According to Prof Xiang Yutao, fear, a feeling of uncertainty, and suffering from the stigma of getting infected are common among people affected by epidemic outbreaks and these symptoms may seriously affect the outcomes of clinical treatment. Based on previous experience in the prevention and control of several worldwide acute infectious diseases, the implementation of comprehensive psychological tests and timely psychological treatment and intervention is of great significance in the fight against the 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Prof Xiang is a professor in the Faculty of Health Sciences and a registered psychiatrist. Since 2007, he has published more than 410 papers in leading SCI-indexed international journals, including Lancet , Lancet Psychiary , JAMA Psychiatry , World Psychiatry , and Am J Psychiatry . He has received more than ten international scientific research awards. His main research interests include psychiatry clinical medicine, clinical evidence-based medicine, and clinical epidemiology of psychiatry.​\n",

      "Tweet: The Wuhan coronavirus has proved less deadly so far than the infamous SARS pandemic that spread around the world in 2003. But if it were to graduate to a pandemic — and it is already spreading exponentially faster than SARS — this current strain has more potential to curb the outlooks for both aviation and the global economy than its predecessor did.\n",
      "For one thing, travel has made the world far more interconnected than in 2003, accelerating the rate of infection. China — the starting point for both viruses — has become the world’s largest outbound tourism market and one of the engines driving the global economy. In the intervening years since the SARS outbreak, global airline capacity into China is 3.8 times larger than it was in 2005. China flights now account for 12 percent of total worldwide available seat kilometers versus only five percent 15 years ago, according to PlaneStats.com, Oliver Wyman’s aviation data portal .\n",
      "In 2003, because of the SARS outbreak, airlines worldwide saw a decline in traffic with those operating out of Asia Pacific losing as much as eight percent on an annual basis, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). That amounts to a reduction of 39 billion revenue passenger kilometers — a standard metric for air traffic volume. The outbreak cost those airlines around $6 billion in lost revenue. In North America, the loss to airlines was around $1 billion as revenue passenger kilometers dropped 12.8 billion, or 3.7 percent of total international traffic, IATA reported.\n",
      "According to PlaneStats.com, Asian airlines currently have the biggest capacity exposure to China, at 30 percent of all the available seat kilometers. Second are airlines operating out of Australia and New Zealand with 11 percent. Europe has 4.5 percent; North America, 4 percent; the Middle East, 3.6 percent; and Africa, 3.1 percent.\n",
      "Cancelling flights\n",
      "As of January 30, at least 43 airlines had cancelled some or all flights into China in response to the spread of the deadly respiratory ailment, known as 2019-nCoV, and nations around the world have been evacuating their citizens. The United States State Department issued a warning to citizens not to travel to China, as consumers were already avoiding travel there even when flights were available. With only five confirmed cases in the United States, a survey out of the University of Florida found that 19 percent of Americans were changing bookings on travel plans in the next three months because of the virus, and another 52 percent said they are now worried about international travel.\n",
      "As 2020 began, the aviation industry globally was already looking forward to slowing demand for air travel, reflecting in part a general deceleration in economic growth around the world. The industry outlook is still profitable, although margins continue to be under pressure. After a decline in global air cargo in 2019 caused by an escalating trade war between the United States and China, a tentative truce brightened the outlook and encouraged many to predict that the risk of recession was dissipating.\n",
      "China’s growth, as well as the expansion of its middle class, has been fueling the expansion in global aviation for several years. But even before the Wuhan coronavirus, the Chinese economy had been showing signs of slowing down with several forecasts calling for GDP growth in 2020 under six percent. Already in 2019, China reported its slowest growth rate in almost 30 years. In 2003, the SARS coronavirus cut global economic activity by $33 billion, and that was when China only accounted for four percent of global output. Today its share is more than four times that.\n",
      "Escalating numbers\n",
      "China is being far more proactive in its efforts to contain the spread of the virus than it was during the SARS pandemic. In response to the Wuhan virus, China has already restricted the mobility of some 60 million of its citizens by putting 16 cities in lockdown, including the city of Wuhan, one of the largest cities in China and a major industrial hub where 11 million people live.\n",
      "The virus restrictions hit China at a particularly unfortunate time — during Lunar New Year when much of the country travels to visit relatives and tourists come to celebrate. Thanks to the closures of factories and other businesses throughout China and China’s dominant role in the global supply chain, many are predicting temporary disruptions in manufacturing globally because of the virus.\n",
      "Even with the closures, the virus is spreading fast. Since the first case in December, the disease has infected more than 9,700 people worldwide in less than two months — already more than the 8,098 infected during the SARS outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003. And the number is moving up daily. Most of the sick are in China, but at least 21 nations have reported cases, including Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam, the United States, Germany, Singapore, and South Korea. As of January 30, 213 people had died — all in China. During the SARS pandemic, 774 people died. No vaccine for the Wuhan virus has been developed yet.\n",
      "While the economic repercussions from this outbreak are likely to be short lived as was the impact from the SARS pandemic, the disease is hitting at a time when the global economy is somewhat fragile and investors nervous, increasing the downside risk.\n",

      "For reasons that haven't been shared with the public, the WHO has chosen to lavish praise on Beijing, insisting that travel to China isn't dangerous even as more governments impose restrictions, and claiming that Beijing has been completely transparent and a 'model' for how countries should handle outbreaks like this.\n",
      "When pressed by a reporter, Dr. Tedros, the director general of the WHO, replied that local authorities in Wuhan had been \"very transparent\" with the Chinese people by publishing up-to-date notices about new cases and deaths. First of all, many suspect that Beijing hasn't been entirely truthful as far as these tallies are concerned.\n",
      "Second, it's not so much about what Beijing told the Chinese people. Everybody knows the government censors anything that might reflect badly upon the Communist Party. So to claim that the government has been completely transparent with the people is almost disingenuous. Of course that's not true. But the real issue is what they did and didn't tell the international news media, and their international partners.\n",
      "Now, a new study has exposed the Communist Party's lies.\n",
      "The research has once again moved back the timeline of when senior Chinese leaders knew about the outbreak in Wuhan, suggesting that they waited longer to act, and longer to inform the international community, than they had led the world to believe. The claim appeared in a top American medical journal.\n",
      "From Nikkei Asian Review:\n",
      "The deadly new coronavirus from Wuhan was spreading from person to person as early as mid-December, weeks before China officially confirmed such transmission, government-funded Chinese researchers report in a top American medical journal.\n",
      "The paper in the New England Journal of Medicine analyzes data on the first 425 confirmed cases in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak originated.\n",
      "\"On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019,\" it reads. The paper notes that seven health care workers contracted the virus between Jan. 1 and Jan. 11 - significant evidence of human-\n",
      "The findings sharply contrast with the accounts of Wuhan health authorities who had maintained until mid-January that there was \"no clear evidence\" that the virus could be passed among humans. Officials also claimed Jan. 11 that no health care workers had been infected.\n",
      "But...but...but...the local authorities in Wuhan said they didn't have evidence of person to person transmission until mid-January! That's increasingly difficult to believe, seeing as the signs were clearly there after the first wave of patients was diagnosed and examined and interrogated.\n",
      "Research suggests fewer than 60% of the early virus-carriers had been directly linked to the seafood market. The rest were associates, friends and relatives of the people who had. That, right there, is evidence of human-to-human transmission - and this was known as early as mid-December.\n",
      "Some frustrated Chinese have chosen to defy censors and lash out on Chinese social media networks like Weibo.\n",
      "Many of the paper's authors work for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and local counterparts. Many were among the first batch of medical experts to have entered Wuhan for on-the-ground inspections, developing \"a tailored surveillance protocol to identify potential cases\" on Jan. 3.\n",
      "\"They all knew,\" a user on the Weibo microblogging platform said. \"They just didn't say, but lied to us.\"\n",
      "\"If only they could have told people earlier, we could have taken better preventive measures, and the virus would not have spread this fast,\" another wrote.\n",
      "There have even been reports of the government cremating bodies before they can be brought to a morgue and officially included with the statistics, helping to maintain the illusion that the mortality rate for the novel coronavirus outbreak is far below the rate for SARS at just 2%-3%. In reality, some have suggested the true mortality rate is closer to 11%, as thousands in dire need of treatment are confronted by shortages of supplies and doctors, even as Beijing sends legions of medical \"personnel\" (many of whom are likely just PLA soldiers) to Hubei.\n",
      "Instead of embracing transparency, Beijing back in December arrested several researchers for \"spreading false rumors\" about the severity of the outbreak. Of course, their warnings have since been realized.\n",
      "Some Weibo users have demanded that the authors of the paper expose whoever is responsible for this.\n",
      "\"I'm demanding an explanation from the paper's authors,\" wrote one Weibo user. \"You clearly knew about people-to-people transmission three weeks earlier than the public, but did you do what you were supposed to do?\"\n",
      "The Ministry of Science and Technology issued a statement on Thursday urging researchers in the country to \"not devote their efforts to writing essays before completing the task of combating the novel coronavirus.\"\n",
      "Some social media users in China pointed to another possibility.\n",
      "\"Perhaps the researchers did not have a way to share their findings, and publishing it in a scientific journal was their last resort to warn the public,\" one WeChat user wrote on a group discussion.\n",
      "In December, eight people were detained for \"spreading false rumors\" as they discussed the spread of a then-unknown coronavirus on the internet. The eight people were later identified as doctors working in Wuhan, which sparked a public outcry over government censorship.\n",

Just like a virus, it can be difficult to contain and many working in medical and scientific fields are using the very tools used to spread misinformation to counter it. Though so much misinformation is spread on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and hundreds of other scientists and medical professionals who are studying the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, have been utilizing social media to disseminate accurate information in real time, countering conspiracy theories and collaborating for research. “Today, in this outbreak, we are sharing information almost to the second of its release,” says Crystal Watson, senior researcher and assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “That allows a lot more collective thinking and decision making.” Watson says that social media had made it possible for scientific information to be shared much more quickly. “In prior outbreaks before social media, often we had to wait for a publication in a journal, for example, to learn about some of what was going on,” she says. Many working in scientific and medical fields started to notice the spread of harmful misinformation at the beginning of the outbreak and experts started using their...

The patient is stable and in isolation at a hospital, the statement added.

This week, India readied a state-carrier airplane to travel to Wuhan but was waiting for a nod from Chinese authorities who were trying to sequence the whole evacuation process. \"Only those nationals who don't have the virus will be airlifted, they will be brought into a quarantine facility outside Delhi,\" the official said, requesting anonymity.Demands from South Asian nationals intensified after countries such as the United States and Japan began pulling out their nationals. ---Reuters, Chennai\n",

South Korea got that piece of good news even as President Moon Jae-in was calling for still more emergency measures after 11 cases of the deadly disease were reported in the south. Moon sought to calm what he said were “vague fears” as a plane carrying 386 South Koreans from Wuhan arrived and another plane was due to take off to rescue more than 300 Koreans stuck in the city, cut off from road and rail traffic since the disease was first diagnosed there several weeks ago.\n",
      "South Korea’s composite stock index, the KOSPI, closed down 1.35% going into the weekend as investors worried about the impact of the virus on Korean companies in South Korea and their operations in China.\n",
      "Word of the North’s decision not to demand the destruction of all the hotels and other structures that Hyundai Engineering and Construction put up for visitors to Mount Geumgang, a complex of craggy peaks just above the North-South line near the east coast, came via a North-South telephone line that had been reopened especially to coordinate on moves to keep the virus from spreading.\n",
      "The North Korean side said the plan to tear down the buildings, denounced by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as “unpleasant looking,” would be postponed until fears of the disease had been “completely eased.” A South Korean spokesman said North and South Korea needed “relevant discussions” on the topic, which the North had previously refused, but officials for both the government and Hyundai Asan , responsible for operating the zone, hoped Kim’s dream of replacing the buildings with entirely new structures to his liking would be postponed indefinitely.\n",
      "More than a million South Korean tourists had visited the zone over a 10-year period before the South in 2008 halted tours after a South Korean woman was shot and killed by a North Korean soldier who saw her wandering outside the tourist area to look at the sunrise.\n",
      "South Korean finance officials sought to allay fears about the virus spreading even as major manufacturers curtailed operations. Hong Nam-ki, finance minister, said the virus scare was having “limited impact on economic indicators” while the government made “thorough quarantine operations so that the simmering signs of economic recovery will lead to an actual rebound of the economy.”\n",
      "Major Korean car and electronics manufacturers said they were carefully monitoring the impact of the virus but still were not planning om suspending operations. At Hyundaiu Motor Securities, analyst Roh Geum-chang told Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, that there was a chance “this outbreak could have a short-term impact on the global supply chain.”\n",
      "Decisions rested in part on whether China would extend the week-long lunar new year holiday, ending this weekend, while battling to curtail the disease, which has already claimed the lives of more than 200 Chinese.\n",
      "If the holiday lasts another week, “We cannot ignore the impact,” said an official at SK Hynix, Korea’s second largest producer of semiconductors after Samsung Electronics. SK Hynix net profit last year came to just above 2 trillion won, down 87% from the year before.\n",
      "Even if the virus is not immediately held responsible for disappointing sales figures, its impact was felt in other ways. After two people were discovered to have dined at Hanilkwan, a restaurant chain, one of its eateries shut down. Ditto for a multiplex in the CJ CGV chain after another person carrying the virus was reported to have seen a film there. The popcorn machine was turned off too.\n",

      "KARACHI: The first consignment of primers (reagents) to detect the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will reach the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, on Friday from Japan, enabling the federal health officials to test at least 1000 samples for the lethal virus, officials told The News on Thursday.\n",
      "\"The government of Japan has donated primers which would reach NIH Islamabad on Friday morning. This would enable us to analyze at least 1,000 suspected samples for the novel Coronavirus that has wreaked havoc in China and created panic all over the world,” said Dr. Muhammad Salman, Chief Public Health, Labs Division, NIH, while talking to The News.\n",
      "At the moment, Pakistan lacks the capacity to detect the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is a new virus that causes serious respiratory illness in people and can spread from person-to-person. This virus was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan city of China and now it has spread to at least 15 countries, infecting over 7,000 people and causing 150 deaths in China alone.\n",
      "The NIH Islamabad official said that so far no person was diagnosed with Coronavirus infection in Pakistan but that could primarily be due to absence of primers used to detect the new virus but added that after receiving primers from Japan, experts at the NIH Islamabad would be able to detect the novel Coronavirus in samples.\n",
      "In addition to Japanese authorities, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Atlanta, United States would also provide primers to Pakistan, the NIH expert said adding that they were also trying to procure these reagents and kits from Germany and China so as to enhance their capacity and deal with any eventuality in the country. \"Some countries including Japan and CDC, Atlanta, USA, are donating the primers while we have also approached some other countries including Germany and China to procure primers for the detection of novel Coronavirus,\" Dr. Salman said adding that they had also approached Hong Kong for the preparation of primers to be used for sample analysis in Pakistan.\n",
      "To a query, Dr. Salman said health facilities declared and designated as focal points in the provinces could send the samples of suspected patients by using 'viral transport media' to NIH Islamabad and added that the National Institute of Health (NIH) would be responsible for detection and confirmation of novel Coronavirus cases in the country.\n",
      "He said although the World Health Organization had not yet declared the emergence of novel Coronavirus as public health emergency so far, but the WHO is going to reconvene the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on the new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) shortly to advise on whether the current outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.\n",
      "Another official of the NIH told The News that some friendly countries were also providing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to Pakistan to deal with suspected patients at the health facilities and added the World Health Organization (WHO) office in Islamabad was also trying to acquire primers, personal protective equipment, supportive medicines and viral transport media.\n",
      "Meanwhile, officials at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) Karachi claimed that they were also in the process of acquiring the kits and primers to detect the new Coronavirus as suspected cases were being referred to the AKUH by the authorities as they are the only health facility in Sindh to have the capability to detect serious viral respiratory diseases like SARS and MERS.\n",
      "An official of AKUH said once they acquire the Real-time rRT-PCR Panel Primers and Probes, they would also be able to analyse the samples for the novel Coronavirus.\n",
      "It is worth mentioning here that at least eight Chinese nationals, as well as some Pakistani citizens, were taken to the AKUH last week on suspicion of suffering from Coronavirus infection after they reported flu with fever and difficulty in breathing while they also had a history of travelling to China this month.

      "Tweet: Coronavirus: How effective are face masks? Should we be worried about the shortage? There are reports of face mask shortages around the world. camera MARK RALSTON/AFP via Getty Images\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has just declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.\n",
      "There have been nearly 10,000 cases of the so-called 2019-nCoV in China, 23 countries affected and more than 213 deaths globally.\n",
      "China, Germany, the U.S. and several other countries confirmed the virus can spread person to person, even from people without any symptoms.\n",
      "Now there are reports of face mask shortages around the world , including Australia , the U.S. and in many cities of China .\n",
      "How concerned should we be about these shortages? Or can we just wrap a scarf or piece of cloth around our face to protect against infection? How important are face masks?\n",
      "For a disease with no drug or vaccine yet, non-pharmaceutical measures are the mainstay of control. This includes personal protective equipment, such as face masks.\n",
      "But the type of face masks we typically see (surgical masks) do not provide a seal around the face or filtration of airborne particles, like those that may carry coronavirus.\n",
      "They do however provide a limited physical barrier against you transferring the virus from your hand to the face, or from large droplets and splashes of fluid.\n",
      "You also need to put on and remove your mask properly, as this advice from the World Health Organization shows:\n",
      "Disposable respirators reduce the risk of respiratory infections. They are designed to fit around the face and to filter 95% of airborne particles. However, these should be reserved for health workers, who need them most. Do we really need these masks anyway? The type of face masks we typically see do not provide a seal around the face or filtration of airborne particles, like those that may carry coronavirus.\n",
      "In the disease epicenter, Wuhan, or on an evacuation flight out of Wuhan, face masks are a sensible precaution. They are also needed in other Chinese cities that are affected by the outbreak and where transmission is ongoing.\n",
      "However, in countries where transmission is not widespread and there are only a handful of cases being treated in hospital isolation rooms, masks serve no purpose in the community.\n",
      "For example, there is no need for the general public to use face masks in Australia, U.S. and other counties where a few imported cases are reported, and the risk of catching the virus is low.\n",
      "Panic buying will result in a lack of supplies when we need them most, for instance, if the number of cases escalates dramatically. During the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, the WHO did not recommend the general public use face masks.\n",
      "The case is different for health workers, who face greater risks. It is essential we provide health workers with the best protection, because if they get sick or die, we lose our ability to fight the epidemic. During the SARS epidemic, 21% of all cases globally were health workers. How concerned should we be about the shortage of face masks?\n",
      "This is a concern, especially if people hoard or stockpile face masks when there is no need. We saw a shortage of masks early during the 2009 influenza pandemic. The surge in demand during such events also results in higher prices.\n",
      "Countries have started releasing stockpiles of masks and other personal protective equipment to the health system. For example, the Australian government this week released one million masks for general practices and pharmacists from the national medical stockpile.\n",
      "There is also an existing shortage of masks in some areas of Australia due to the bushfire response and face masks from the national stockpile have mainly been released in those areas . What happens if the situation gets worse?\n",
      "The number of cases is expected to increase and a large quantity of face masks may be needed. See also How do I know if I might have coronavirus? 5 questions answered\n",
      "If the current situation becomes a pandemic (an epidemic that goes global), we could be facing a much greater demand for personal protective equipment in the health sector alone.\n",
      "In a modelled serious epidemic in Sydney of smallpox , if health workers use two disposable respirators a day for 6 months, over 30 million respirators will be needed for 100,000 clinical health workers.\n",
      "China is the largest producer of face masks globally and it has already stepped up production to meet the high demand.\n",
      "If large outbreaks happen in other countries, China may not be able to meet the demand of face masks, respirators and other medical supplies. Not all face masks are up to the job\n",
      "Another problem is the sale of low-quality face masks due to a shortage of products on the market, as has been reported in China and Hong Kong.\n",
      "Face masks are not regulated, may not filter the air, and also typically allow large amounts of air in through the sides. With a shortage of masks, low-quality masks could be exported to other countries. If I can’t get hold of a mask, can I wrap a scarf around my face?\n",
      "Wrapping cloth around your face probably will not protect you. That’s because a scarf or a hanky does not provide a tight fit around the face, isn’t designed to filter out air and may be contaminated.\n",
      "However, during the Ebola epidemic, a woman nursed her entire family through the illness using home-made protective equipment and did not get infected.\n",
      "In Asia, cloth masks are popular because they are cheap and re-usable. But they don’t protect you. Cloth masks may even increase your risk of infection, especially if you don’t wash them regularly. They may absorb moisture and provide a breeding ground for bugs.\n",
      "So, ideally, people shouldn’t be using them. However, people may resort to cloth if there is no other choice. In a nutshell\n",

      "DURHAM, N.C. — Cree, Inc. announced revenue of $239.9 million for its second quarter of fiscal 2020, ended December 29, 2019. This represents a 14% decrease compared to revenue of $280.5 million reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and a 1% decrease compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. GAAP net loss from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest for the second quarter was $52.8 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest of $0.2 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. On a non-GAAP basis, net loss from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was $10.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 of $21.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted share. GAAP and non-GAAP net losses from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 include a $8.3 million reserve on inventory related to Huawei.

      "NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Buyout firm Carlyle Group Inc has delayed the U.S. initial public offering (IPO) of its German specialty chemicals group Atotech, concerned that the coronavirus outbreak would negatively impact the valuation it could achieve with investors, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.\n",
      "Carlyle's decision highlights the uncertainty that the spread of the virus in China and around the world has brought to financial markets, with the benchmark S&P 500 Index <.SPX> on track for its worst week since August.\n",
      "Atotech, which makes specialty chemicals and equipment for printed circuit boards and semiconductors, had planned to kick off its IPO process this week by publishing an indicated price range.\n",

      "It could not be learned when Atotech was planning to resume its IPO preparations. If the delay extends beyond Feb. 14, the company would have to resubmit its IPO filing to U.S. regulators to include full-year earnings, pushing back the process further.\n",

      "The World Health Organization announced Thursday that the outbreak of a deadly and fast-spreading strain of coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency.\n",
      "\"Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen, which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.\n",
      "However, Tedros was adamant that \"the main reason for the declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries. ... Let me be clear — this vote is not a declaration of no confidence in China.\" He said that the WHO is deeply concerned about what will happen if the virus begins spreading in countries with weak health systems and that the purpose of the declaration is to help those countries.\n",
      "The declaration of a global health emergency can work to galvanize international funding. According to the WHO's procedures , the three criteria for such a declaration are that it is an \"extraordinary event,\" that it \"constitute[s] a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease\" and that it \"potentially require[s] a coordinated international response.\"\n",
      "The last time the WHO announced an international health emergency was in July 2019 over the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Before that, international emergencies were declared in 2016 for the Zika virus and in 2014 for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n",
      "The new coronavirus has sickened around 9,800 people worldwide and killed at least 213 , all of them in China.\n",
      "The WHO said in a statement that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.\n",
      "\"There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. WHO doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement,\" Tedros added. But the WHO also said that in certain circumstances, such as when there are many cases of transmission among a vulnerable population, such measures could be \"temporarily useful.\"\n",
      "The coronavirus drew worldwide attention after Chinese authorities began reporting cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan last month. They were able to pinpoint the cause to a previously unknown strain. Other forms of coronavirus, such as SARS and MERS, have been responsible for past international outbreaks.\n",
      "Health authorities believe this particular strain, known as 2019-nCoV, likely first spread from an animal. China's National Health Commission has said it is associated with exposure at a seafood market in Wuhan that also sold live animals.\n",
      "Since then, the virus has spread from Wuhan to countries around the world, including the United States, Japan, Singapore and Thailand. \"The vast majority of those cases are still associated with travel to Wuhan,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program.\n",
      "\"We know that this virus can cause severe disease and that it can kill, although for most people it causes milder symptoms,\" Tedros told reporters last week. The WHO said that about 20% of those infected experience severe illness .\n",
      "Experts find the new coronavirus particularly concerning for several reasons. First, the WHO said there is evidence that the virus could spread from human to human. \"The disease is mainly a respiratory disease passing via droplets from one person to another and mostly still through close contact,\" Ryan said.\n",
      "The droplets could come from sneezing, coughing or even talking. This is worrying because it is easier for a virus to spread quickly between humans compared with a virus transmitted from an animal to humans. Human-to-human transmission has now been documented in three countries outside China, Tedros said.\n",
      "Second, experts still don't know for certain what animal the virus originated from in Wuhan. \"Until we know what the animal is, there potentially could still be animals being sold in markets all across China that is spilling virus over into people,\" Matthew Frieman, a virologist with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, recently told NPR's Nurith Aizenman .\n",
      "And third, Chinese authorities say the virus has also infected medical workers — people who already would be taking serious precautions to protect themselves.\n",
      "There is currently no targeted drug to treat the virus, Chinese health authorities said. And there is no vaccine to guard against it. Tedros is calling on countries to \"accelerate the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\"\n",
      "Several countries, including the U.S., have started to evacuate citizens from Wuhan because of concerns about the coronavirus. As NPR's Bill Chappell reported , American passengers broke into cheers after their flight from Wuhan touched down Tuesday night in Alaska. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising that travelers \"avoid all nonessential travel to all of [China].\"\n",
      "Major airlines, such as United Airlines and British Airways, have suspended flights to Chinese cities.\n",
      "Chinese health authorities recently announced new sweeping measures to try to contain the new coronavirus by implementing a strict quarantine on Wuhan, a city of some 11 million people. \"There's no sense of when the quarantine might be lifted,\" NPR's Emily Feng reported from Beijing. \"The big problem is that people are going to have to return to work soon, when the Lunar New Year is over. Many of them are coming from villages where there are very few screening measures for the virus.\"\n",
      "China's government has come under criticism for not responding more quickly to the outbreak. But WHO officials have praised the Chinese response.\n",
      "\"The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak, despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the Chinese people,\" Tedros said. \"In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response.\" Copyright 2020 NPR.

      "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped on Friday following sharp losses this week, as the World Health Organization (WHO) came out against travel and trade restrictions in declaring a global emergency over the spread of the coronavirus that originated in China last year.\n",
      "Oil prices had fallen nearly 4% through Thursday this week - hitting three-months lows - before rebounding on Friday, with investors and traders worried over how the spreading virus would impact demand for oil and its products.\n",
      "\"The WHO declared a global health emergency but more importantly said travel and trade restrictions were not necessary,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.\n",
      "Brent crude futures <LCOc1> jumped 90 cents to $59.19 a barrel by 0243 GMT, after falling 2.5% the previous session. Brent is still down 2.5% for the week.\n",
      "U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures <CLc1> were up by $1.03 to $53.17 a barrel. The contract fell 2.2% on Thursday and is now 1.9% lower for the week.\n",
      "The WHO on Thursday declared that the coronavirus outbreak in China - which has killed more than 200 people there and has spread to some 18 countries - now constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.\n",
      "Despite the WHO announcement and the rebound in prices on Friday, analysts remained cautious and warned of further downside risks if the virus continues to spread.\n",
      "\"Oil's January correction, a 13% drop to be exact, was ripe for a bounce,\" said Moya.\n",
      "\"Oil is likely to remain vulnerable here despite today's optimism that the coronavirus has likely been contained.\"\n",
      "Italy's government decided to close all air traffic between Italy and China, and airlines including Air France, American Airlines and British Airways have stopped flying to Chinese cities.\n",

      "The Division of Public Health has posted information on its website and is sharing information about coronavirus, also called 2019-nCoV, and our activities related to the outbreak.\n",
      "While the risk to the general public is considered low, we consider any new infectious disease a serious concern and are working with health care providers to promptly identify and evaluate any suspected cases.\n",
      "Dr. Karyl Rattay is the director of the Delaware Division of Public Health. (Photo: Courtesy of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services.)\n",
      "It is important to recognize that the current investigation and response are dynamic, and frequently changing, and new information about the disease may impact the response. DPH will keep the public updated.\n",
      "At this time, there are only a handful of confirmed cases in the U.S., and none in Delaware, though we recognize that could change at any time. DPH is investigating one potential case of 2019 novel coronavirus in a Kent County resident. Test results from the CDC are expected in the coming days.\n",
      "The individual is currently hospitalized in isolation out of an abundance of caution. There is no widespread risk to hospital staff, patients or visitors. All appropriate protective precautions are being taken at all hospitals statewide.\n",
      "Risk for contracting coronavirus is based on exposure. At this time, only those individuals who have recently traveled to China or been in close contact with someone who has and is ill, have an increased risk for becoming ill themselves.\n",
      "Delaware: State investigating possible coronavirus case in Kent County\n",
      "DPH is not currently recommending exclusion from work or school of asymptomatic persons arriving from China but employers should review their own procedures and staff responsibilities to determine the need for exclusion.\n",
      "For persons without an associated travel risk, it should be assumed that most respiratory illnesses are not the 2019 novel coronavirus. As you know, we are in the heart of flu and respiratory disease season, and with more than 2,000 cases statewide, Delawareans have a greater risk of contracting the flu than coronavirus.\n",
      "Symptoms of coronavirus are most similar to lower respiratory infections with patients having fever, cough and shortness of breath. There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection.\n",
      "While in some cases illnesses can be severe and require hospitalization, many individuals infected with coronavirus recover by resting, drinking plenty of liquids, and taking pain and fever-reducing medications.\n",
      "We have asked Delaware health care providers to alert us if a person with recent travel to China becomes sick with respiratory symptoms. When cases are reported, laboratory samples are collected and submitted to the CDC for confirmatory testing.\n",
      "Former police: De-escalation is not new term, training for Delaware\n",
      "Not enough: More de-escalation training is needed for police\n",
      "We have had a handful of calls from providers and have followed up. If at any point testing confirms a case of novel coronavirus in a Delaware resident, the details and protective recommendations would be shared with the affected parties and the public as quickly as possible.\n",
      "When a new disease is circulating, it’s natural for people to ask what they can do to protect themselves and their families. The best guidance at this point is to take the same precautions recommended for avoiding colds and flu: People should stay home when they are sick, cover their cough and practice good hand washing.\n",

They've gotten to the point now where they do things that confirm that they have become a total joke. They are a parody, a satire of network news. There is a tweet here: \"Coronavirus task force another example of Trump administration's lack of diversity.\" They have a picture... I'm not kidding. They have a picture of the Trump coronavirus task force meeting to deal with whatever this is, and the only thing CNN notices is how many white people are in it. I'm not kidding you. I didn't take a screenshot for the Dittocam. I wasn't thinking, but it doesn’t matter. (sigh) Let's see, there are one, two, three... It's the president and three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine people here, and they're all white. So CNN -- just anything, anything to condemn the Trump administration -- says, \"Lack of diversity.\" No African-Americans, no minorities in the task force dealing with the coronavirus. So, what? It's illegitimate? So, what, it doesn't matter? So, what? It's not something that's serious? We can't take it seriously; Trump is such a racist pig? It's just... This is the kind of stuff that is divisive and helps divide a country, not Trump, and not Republicans, not conservatives. \n",

      "Decade-long structural studies by Fang Li of the University of Minnesota, et al. have shown how the SARS virus (SARS-CoV) interacts with animal and human hosts in order to infect them. The mechanics of infection by the Wuhan coronavirus appear to be similar. These investigators used the knowledge they gleaned from multiple SARS-CoV strains—isolated from different hosts in different years—and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors from different animal species to model predictions for the novel Wuhan coronavirus. (Both viruses use ACE2 to gain entry into the cell, but it serves normally as a regulator for heart function.)\n",
      "\"Our structural analyses confidently predict that the Wuhan coronavirus uses ACE2 as its host receptor,\" the investigators wrote. That and several other structural details of the new virus are consistent with the ability of the Wuhan coronavirus to infect humans and with some capability to transmit among humans.\n",
      "\"Alarmingly, our data predict that a single mutation [at a specific spot in the genome] could significantly enhance [the Wuhan coronavirus's] ability to bind with human ACE2,\" the investigators write. For this reason, Wuhan coronavirus evolution in patients should be closely monitored for the emergence of novel mutations at the 501 position in its genome, and to a lesser extent, the 494 position, in order to predict the possibility of a more serious outbreak than has been seen so far.

After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first U.S. incident of person-to-person spread of the virus, the WHO said recent weeks have seen an unprecedented outbreak, met by an unprecedented response. It said it was not recommending limiting trade or travel to China. \"The market is starting to look at this and say at some point in time this will crest and the news will start getting better,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. \"Precautions are being taken and that means at some point there will be light at the end of the tunnel, that is when the market reacts constructively.\" Facebook shares slumped 6.14% after the social media company warned of slowing growth as its business matured and it reported a surge in quarterly expenses. The decline weighed on the S&P communication services index , which lost 0.79%. Defensive sectors such as utilities and consumer staples, considered safer in times of economic uncertainties, advanced. The main U.S. stock indexes are on course for their second straight week of declines as the virus has disrupted global travel and forced several companies to suspend operations in China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 124.99 points, or 0.43%, to 28,859.44, the S&P 500 gained 10.26 points, or 0.31%, to 3,283.66 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.77 points, or 0.26%, to 9,298.93. Earnings expectations have been slowly improving for S&P 500 companies, with Refinitiv data showing a 0.7% rise in fourth-quarter profit, compared with a 0.6% decline estimated at the start of the season. Microsoft Corp gained 2.82% after it beat expectations for quarterly earnings, driven by Azure cloud computing revenue growth. Tesla Inc jumped 10.30% after the maker of electric cars posted a second straight quarterly profit as vehicle deliveries hit a record. Altria Inc slid 4.21% after the tobacco company said it took another $4 billion charge on its investment in Juul Labs Inc. Package delivery firm United Parcel Service Inc dropped 6.70% after it forecast full-year earnings below estimates. After the close, Amazon gained 10% after fourth-quarter revenue topped expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.32-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 94 new lows. About 7.72 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.54 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

      "Amazon.com Inc.'s fourth-quarter sales blew past a previous record as robust holiday sales and profit from cloud and advertising businesses helped offset growing shipping costs for its one-day Prime program.\n",
      "The Seattle company's shares jumped more than 10% in after-hours trading, adding about $100 billion to the company's market value. Should the stock keep the gains Friday, Amazon would be the fourth U.S. company to finish with a market cap above $1 trillion.\n",
      "Profit rose 8% to $3.3 billion during the all-important holiday quarter, after sliding more than 25% from July to September due to its costly one-day shipping effort for Prime members. The company beat its quarterly profit estimate of between $1.2 billion and $2.9 billion. Earnings per share were $6.47, compared with analyst estimates of $4.04 a share, according to a survey by FactSet.\n",
      "Amazon's fourth-quarter revenue rose 21% to $87.4 billion from a year earlier.\n",
      "\"There was investor concern that one-day shipping would be a drag to margins, so the fact that they have been able to offer one-day shipping and also at the same time drive some efficiency has to please investors, \" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said.\n",
      "The company's shipping costs rose to $12.88 billion, a 43% increase from a year earlier. Amazon's costs to build out one-day shipping capabilities have continued to surge as Amazon moves inventory closer to customers. One-day spending reached more than $800 million from April to June and was expected to nearly double in the fourth quarter to $1.5 billion.\n",
      "Last month, Amazon said that it had its best holiday shopping season ever, with billions of orders received globally. The National Retail Federation reported that U.S. holiday sales grew by 4.1% in 2019, with online sales growing 15%.\n",
      "Amazon said it has more than 150 million Prime members world-wide.\n",
      "Members pay $119 a year to access free and fast shipping options, Amazon's streaming service, discounts at Whole Foods Market and other benefits.\n",
      "The last time Amazon disclosed the number of Prime members was in April 2018, when the company said it had more than 100 million members.\n",
      "Amazon's holiday results outperformed competitors, who reported weak results for the quarter. Target Corp.'s holiday sales missed its forecasts partly due to a slump in sales in the toy and electronics categories. Macy's Inc., J.C. Penney Co., Kohl's Corp. and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands Inc. all reported lower sales for November and December.\n",
      "In the quarter, Amazon spent a little less than the $1.5 billion it projected for the quarter to fuel its one-day Prime shipping program, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said during a call with media.\n",
      "\"We are getting more efficient,\" he said.\n",
      "The company expects an additional $1 billion in costs related to the program next quarter. As the company fulfills more one-day orders, it has added warehouse and delivery employees.\n",
      "Amazon's head count grew by 23% to 798,000 from a year earlier.\n",
      "Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud-computing operation and its main profit center, continued to show signs of slowing growth.\n",
      "The unit delivered $10 billion in sales, rising 34% from a year earlier. The division had historically grown by more than 40% each quarter.\n",
      "Operating income for AWS rose 19% to $2.6 billion. During the quarter, Amazon's cloud-computing business suffered a blow when the Pentagon chose competitor Microsoft Corp. as its vendor for a $10 billion government contract. Amazon is protesting the result.\n",
      "By contrast, Microsoft posted record sales Wednesday buoyed by its cloud-computing business. The company's cloud-computing sales increased 62% in its fiscal second quarter from a year ago.\n",
      "Amazon's advertising business posted $4.8 billion in sales, a 41% increase from the year-earlier period. The unit, which sells advertising space in the form of sponsored products in search and display ads, has become another cash cow for the company.\n",
      "Amazon's international business posted another operating loss for the quarter, and profit declined 15.6% in its North American unit, which includes the bulk of its e-commerce operations.\n",
      "The physical stores segment, which includes Whole Foods, had $4.4 billion in sales for the period, down 1% from a year ago.\n",
      "Amazon said it expects first-quarter sales of between $69 billion and $73 billion.\n",
      "It projected its operating income to fall to between $3 billion and $4.2 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in first quarter 2019.\n",
      "\"We're watching it very carefully,\" Mr. Olsavsky said in response to a question on whether the coronavirus outbreak in China would affect business operations. Amazon doesn't have direct operations in Wuhan, China, but a large number of its third-party sellers are from China.\n",

      "Swiss watch sales have underperformed other luxury goods as political protests shook Hong Kong, smartwatches took market share from similarly priced Swiss watches and changes in distribution took their toll.\n",
      "“Group management expects healthy growth in 2020 in all markets in local currency, with the exception of Hong Kong SAR,” the company based in Biel in western Switzerland said in a statement on Thursday.\n",
      "Net profit fell almost 14% to 748 million Swiss francs ($773.1 million) in 2019, and the operating margin declined to 12.4%, from 13.6% a year ago, Swatch Group said, proposing an unchanged dividend of 8 francs per bearer share and 1.60 francs per registered share for 2019.\n",
      "Sales dropped 2.7%, or 1.8% at constant currency, to 8.24 billion francs, hit by a sharp decline in Hong Kong, where the group has over 90 retail stores, Swatch Group said.\n",
      "Shares were indicated to open 4% lower, based on pre-market trading, extending a decline over the last week due to worries over the outbreak of the fast-spreading coronavirus in China that affects watchmakers’ biggest customer group, the Chinese, and the important travel retail channel.\n",
      "“The stock is going to come under pressure as the margin is worse than anticipated and you have news flow on coronavirus getting worse and it is going to impact consumer sentiment and macrodata. Swatch Group is the de facto China play in European consumer,” Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said.\n",
      "Cox said, however, that the group was making lots of efforts to cut costs, the cash flow had improved and the coronavirus fears would likely fade soon.\n",
      "Swatch Group, with its cheap Swatch plastic watches, Tissot sports watches and high-end Omega timepieces, is doing less well than peer Richemont because of its higher exposure to entry-price pieces that are under pressure from smartwatches, and weaker position in the fast-growing jewellery segment.\n",
      "Richemont reported a 4% rise in sales in the quarter to December 31, helped by double-digit growth in China and South Korea, which offset tumbling sales in Hong Kong and Japan.\n",

      "Tweet: Canadian bats are unlikely to be the source of virus strains that can infect humans such as the one currently raising global alarms, a bat expert says.\n",
      "\"We've lived with our bats for a long time and it's never happened,\" said virologist Vikram Misra of the University of Saskatchewan.\n",
      "\"I really think it's not an issue.\"\n",
      "Researchers are closing in on bats as the origin of the new coronavirus scare that has quarantined a Chinese city of 11 million people and infected humans in at least 18 countries.\n",
      "More than 7,700 people in China have been diagnosed with the new virus and 170 of them have died. The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern.\"\n",
      "In research released Thursday, scientists said the new virus is closely related to three coronaviruses found in bats. A separate report published in the medical journal The Lancet said data collected so far is consistent with the virus having initially been hosted by bats.\n",
      "Misra, who has published a series of papers on bat viruses, said even healthy bats are normally full of them, but they are kept in check by the animal's unique immune system.\n",
      "\"There are very, very few viruses that make bats sick.\"\n",
      "But if a healthy bat is put under stress, its immune system is thrown off balance, Misra said. Viruses multiply and the bat starts to release them in bodily fluids such as saliva, urine and feces.\n",
      "The specific kind of stress it takes is still unknown. Misra said he believes caging a bat near other animals it wouldn't normally be around, as happens in live-animal markets, could do the trick.\n",
      "\"We think a whole bunch of different kinds of things that make the animal unhappy work in much the same way to suppress antiviral responses.\"\n",
      "It's likely to have happened before.\n",
      "The deadly SARS and MERS viruses are thought to have begun in bats. A bat virus killed millions of pigs in the United States in 2014 and more recently in China. The Marburg, Nipah and Hendra viruses -- all potentially fatal -- are thought to have originated in bats.\n",
      "North America has large bat populations, which are under stress from loss of habitat, climate change and the spread of disease such as white-nose syndrome. As humans move into previously natural areas, they are increasingly in contact with them.\n",
      "Could it happen here?\n",
      "\"Not really, no,\" said Misra.\n",
      "Our bats do carry coronaviruses, but a different kind.\n",
      "\"As far as we know, that virus is quite different. It's a different subfamily of coronaviruses than the coronavirus that makes up SARS and MERS and the new virus.\"\n",
      "Nor is it likely the local coronavirus could mutate into something dangerous.\n",
      "\"You'd have to have a lot of changes happening to these viruses to get them to make that jump.\"\n",
      "As well, domestic animals in North America aren't typically kept in close proximity to bats.\n",
      "Misra played down the threat posed by the new coronavirus.\n",
      "\"We're panicking too soon and for insufficient reasons. More harm will be done by panicking than the virus itself.\"\n",

It is in the larger interest of the region, world, country that we don't evacuate them now,\" said Mira addressing a press conference.\"This is what the World Health Organization is saying, this is China's policy and this is our policy as well. We stand by China in full solidarity,\" he added.The premier's special assistant also announced that up to four Pakistani students in China were diagnosed with the coronavirus.He said that there were four Pakistani students confirmed to have the coronavirus with links to Wuhan, adding that they will take on the responsibility of these children and all Pakistanis in China.However, the special assistant endorsed that no case of the coronavirus had been confirmed in Pakistan yet.\"There is not even one confirmed case of coronavirus inside Pakistan,\" said Mirza.The halt in flight operations came after WHO's declaration of a global emergency over the spreading coronavirus, as Chinese authorities on Friday increased the toll to 213 dead and nearly 10,000 infections.

      "The Balance of Payments position improved to USD 433.7 billion by September 2019 from USD 412.9 billion of forex reserves in March 2019. This is on the back of Current Account Deficit (CAD) narrowing further to 1.5 per cent of GDP in the first half of 2019-20 from 2.1 per cent in 2018-19.\n",
      "Net FDI inflows remained buoyant attracting USD 24.4 billion in the first eight months of 2019-20, much higher than the corresponding period of 2018-19.

As per World Bank report of 2019, India's 17.5 million diaspora made it the top remittance-recipient country in 2018, informs the Survey.\n",
      "The Survey notes that India's merchandise trade balance improved from 2009-14 to 2014-19 on the back of a decline in crude prices. The merchandise Exports-to-GDP ratio declined to 11.3 per cent, due to weakened global demand and heightened trade tensions over 2018-19 to H1 of 2019-20. Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL), precious stones, drug formulations and biologicals, gold and other precious metals continue to be the top exported commodities; the largest export destinations being United States of America (USA), followed by United Arab Emirates (UAE), China and Hong Kong.\n",
      "The merchandise Imports-to-GDP ratio also declined, entailing a net positive impact on the BoP position. This is because of the large presence of crude oil in the import basket. Share of gold imports, another important component of import basket, has remained stable in spite of a rise in gold prices. Crude petroleum, gold, petroleum products, coal, coke and briquettes constitute top import items. India's imports continue to be largest from China, followed by USA, UAE and Saudi Arabia in that order.\n",
      "The Economic Survey 2019-20 further observes that non-POL-non-gold imports are understood to be positively correlated with GDP growth. However, non-POL-non-oil imports fell as a proportion to GDP from 2009-14 to 2014-19 when GDP growth accelerated. This may have happened because of consumption-driven growth while the investment rate declined. The continuous decline in investment rate decelerated GDP growth, weakened consumption, dampened the investment outlook; which further reduced GDP growth and along with it, non-POL-non-gold imports as a proportion of GDP from 2018-19 to H1 of 2019-20.\n",

      "Tweet: Medical staff in protective clothing carry a suspected virus patient from an apartment in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. AFP/VNA Photo GENEVA The UN health agency on Thursday declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus from China -- a rarely used designation that could lead to improved international co-ordination in tackling the disease.\n",
      "\"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,\" World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he declared a \"public health emergency of international concern\".\n",
      "\"This is not a vote of no confidence in China,\" he said, emphasising repeatedly that the measure was intended to help other countries less able to cope and praising the Chinese government for taking swift action to tackle the outbreak.\n",
      "\"We must all act together now to limit further spread.... We can only stop it together,\" said Tedros, who travelled to China this week and met with President Xi Jinping.\n",
      "Tedros also said there was \"no reason\" for any of the international travel or trade restrictions announced in recent days, such as flight suspensions, border closures and quarantine for apparently healthy travellers.\n",
      "Top airlines including Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa have suspended or cut back services to China.\n",
      "The Italian government said Thursday it was suspending all flights between Italy and China after doctors confirmed two Chinese tourists had tested positive for the coronavirus.\n",
      "The WHO's Emergency Committee, an advisory body of international experts, said in a statement that evidence had shown that restricting movement of people and goods during public health emergencies \"may be ineffective and may divert resources from other interventions\".\n",
      "\"Further, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative effects on the economies of countries affected by the emergencies,\" the committee said.\n",
      "But it added that \"in certain specific circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful\" -- a possible reference to lockdowns within China that have affected millions of people.\n",
      "WHO stopped short of declaring an emergency last week because its emergency committee was divided over the issue.\n",
      "Countries or territories with confirmed cases of the new 2019 novel coronavirus. More than 7,700 people have been infected with the virus -- almost all of them in China -- and 170 have died.\n",
      "The WHO said there have also been 82 confirmed cases in 18 other countries, including cases of onward transmission in Germany, Japan, the United States and Vietnam.\n",
      "The WHO has called a public health emergency of international concern only five times since the relevant legislation took effect in 2007 -- for swine flu, polio, Zika and twice for Ebola outbreaks in Africa.\n",
      "The designation, which is reviewed every three months, allows the WHO to issue global recommendations that the international community is expected to follow.\n",
      "Governments, companies and people around the world have already been escalating efforts to contain the illness, which is believed to have emerged from an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\n",

      "(RTTNews) – The Australian stock market is advancing on Friday following the mostly positive cues overnight from Wall Street after the World Health Organization said it is still too early to declare the coronavirus outbreak in China a global health emergency. Banks and healthcare stocks are among the leading gainers.\n",
      "The benchmark SP/ASX 200 Index is adding 24.60 points or 0.35 percent to 7,112.60, after touching a high of 7,122.70 earlier. The broader All Ordinaries Index is up 24.50 points or 0.34 percent to 7,223.50. Australian stocks declined on Thursday .\n",
      "The big four banks – ANZ Banking, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and National Australia Bank – are higher in a range of 0.7 percent to 1.0 percent .\n",
      "Healthcare stocks are higher amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak in China. Biotechnology firm CSL is advancing 1 percent , while Ansell is higher by more than 1 percent , Ramsay Healthcare is adding 0.6 percent and Sonic Healthcare is rising 0.4 percent .\n",
      "Gold miners are mixed even as gold prices rose to a more than three-week high overnight. Newcrest Mining is rising 1 percent , while Evolution Mining is declining 0.5 percent .\n",
      "Among the major miners, Rio Tinto is losing almost 2 percent , BHP is declining more than 1 percent and Fortescue Metals is edging down 0.2 percent .\n",
      "Oil stocks are also mostly lower after crude oil prices fell to an eight-week low overnight. Oil Search is lower by almost 2 percent and Woodside Petroleum is edging down 0.1 percent , while Santos is adding 0.1 percent .\n",
      "Shares of Insurance Australia Group are losing almost 6 percent after the company said it has received more than 28,000 claims of home and vehicle damage from hailstorms this week and expects these to result in a pre-tax cost of A$169 million. The insurer also lowered its fiscal 2020 insurance profit margin outlook.\n",
      "In the currency market, the Australian dollar was quoted at $0.6842 on Friday, down from $0.6859 on Thursday .\n",
      "On Wall Street, stocks recovered on Thursday after seeing early weakness amid lingering concerns about the impact of the Chinese coronavirus . Stocks showed a notable recovery after the World Health Organization said it is still too early to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A steep drop by shares of Travelers helped keep the Dow in the red after the insurance giant reported fourth quarter earnings and revenues that beat estimates but slightly weaker than expected net premiums written.\n",
      "While the Dow edged down 26.18 points or 0.1 percent to 29,160.06, the Nasdaq rose 18.71 points or 0.2 percent to 9,402.48 and the SP 500 inched up 3.79 points or 0.1 percent to 3,325.54.\n",

      "Tweet: The man who was diagnosed as Canada’s first confirmed case of coronavirus was discharged from a Toronto hospital Friday morning.\n",
      "While the news may be jarring to some residents, CTV News' Infectious Diseases Expert Dr. Neil Rau says that there is little to worry about.\n",
      "Q: How significant is it that the patient has been released?\n",
      "A: I expected that we would ultimately release someone and that this is not really a big deal. People can’t stay in hospital forever just because they have an infection like this. They can isolate themselves at home and it shouldn’t be a problem.\n",
      "Q:How long are people with coronavirus contagious?\n",
      "A: What we don’t know is how long people stay contagious for and there’s a lot of research interest in monitoring such patients with daily tests to check the level of virus---when you take a swab from the nose—to see how many days it takes for that to go away. So there’s varying guidance on how long people remain contagious for, but I’ll give a ball park: Maximum is probably seven days, but we don’t exactly know yet.\n",
      "Q: Was the W.H.O’s global health emergency declaration justified?\n",
      "A: It’s justified but it’s mainly to help under resourced countries address this. I think there’s still an optimism that we can contain this if everybody does the right thing and some of the poorer countries that don’t have resources, don’t have the ability to do that. So if we didn’t have an emergency declaration, they wouldn’t be able to do it\n",
      "Q: How is the virus spreading in China?\n",
      "A:The theory is that this virus is spreading only from people who are very sick who are in contact with close contacts. There is some emerging information that came out in the New England Journal yesterday suggesting that people with mild disease could actually be quite contagious or even those without symptoms maybe could be contagious.This may cause a lot of people to be scared, but it’s actually a form of good news.\n",
      "The reason I say this is if someone has mild disease and they can spread it there might be a lot of disease that’s gone on under the radar that is not serious and that’s not causing serious infection, serious enough to bring someone to hospital.\n",
      "So, maybe we’ve only identified the tip of the iceberg, the most serious cases, and there’s a whole ocean of mild disease out there. The other side of it though is that if people with mild disease can spread, it’s going to be very difficult to fully control the spread of this virus using the efforts we’re doing now. We may have to live with it and face the consequences, which may not be that bad anyway.\n",
      "Q: What do you make of the way in which the Ontario government has handled the coronavirus?\n",
      "A:I think we’re doing the right thing, for now. We’re assuming the worst case scenario. We are prepared as if this is a SARS-like virus. But if this turns out to be transmitted more like a typical respiratory virus like the flu, then maybe we need to rethink the strategy and maybe we can even relax the strategy—we’re not there yet.\n",
      "Q: What is your message to Torontonians looking to purchase surgical masks in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak?\n",
      "A:I think there’s an epidemic of fear and wearing a mask is pointless. There’s no way you can wear a mask continuously and have it be effective. You’ll start touching your face and nose and this and that. It’s not going to work.\n",
      "Q: Should I be worried?\n",
      "A: This threat, if it’s really widespread in the community, is not a big threat. It’s another respiratory virus just like any other. If it’s not widespread in the community and it is a more dangerous virus like SARS, then really the problem stays contained to health care facilities and where people are the sickest and we can control it anyway. So, this is why quarantine isn’t very effective either.\n",
      "This is why, frankly, people avoiding all travel to China is an overreaction as well. I mean, airlines are cancelling flights mainly for business reasons so they don’t want to fly empty airplanes because people are freaked out. But it doesn’t mean the virus has become meaner or that the disease is really that terrible.\n",

Authorities also collect information and receive reports on arrivals who entered the country during the past couple of weeks. In the case of any passenger arriving from China or from any other country in which that person has intermingled with any person infected by the novel Coronavirus and if that arrival shows any symptoms of fever, coughing, sneezing or felt chest pain or experienced difficulty in breathing upon arriving to the Sudan, then he would be considered \"a suspected case\". It is evident that a \"suspicious case\" is not a proven \"case \"as some social media outlets have been circulating today. But soonest a person is suspected, a monitoring medial team would pay a visit to the said individual, carry out further information and extract samples for laboratory check inside the Sudan to ascertain he or she is not affected by such disease as Saris influenza or other diseases such as corona) samples will also be dispatched outside the Sudan for lab rotary check to fully verify the case. These deep analyses on the coronavirus are not available in the Sudan. In the meantime, two persons (one from Khartoum and another from Gazira state) have reported that they were coming from China and that upon arriving in the Sudan they felt the symptoms of influenza. Thus a team from the Ministry of Health paid a visit to each of them, swabbed and collected samples. These samples were then flown to local and foreign laboratories for verification in the manner related above. Up to now the results haven't come out for any of the samples dispatched, therefore these two persons are classified as \"suspected\" not \"proven cases\" of coronavirus.\n",

      "BOISE, Idaho — The Treasure Valley’s economic forecast for 2020 got a big thumbs up from an economist on Thursday, but it came with a warning about how housing affordability could be a looming problem for Boise.\n",
      "Matthew Gardner, Windermere Real Estate’s chief economist, addressed a crowd of several hundred in the ballroom of JUMP Thursday morning to give his annual predictions for the 2020 economy in Boise and nationwide, according to the Idaho Press .\n",
      "With wry humor sprinkled throughout the presentation, Gardner gave a glowing prediction for Boise’s growth driven by an influx of new residents and companies, plus the relatively low cost of living compared to the western United States.\n",
      "RELATED: Idaho's economy is booming, but rising cost of living could impact the state in coming years\n",
      "Gardner's Economic & Housing Forecast was hosted by Windermere Real Estate.\n",
      "Most of his presentation focused on positives, like Boise’s vibrant downtown, single-digit numbers of homeowners underwater on their mortgages, and low unemployment rate. But toward the end he cautioned about the city reaching a point where working-class residents could no longer afford to live in city limits.\n",
      "“Do not kill the goose that’s laying a ton of golden eggs right now, because at some point affordability is going to become an issue,” he said. “At a point firefighters and nurses, where are they going to live? They’re going to get pushed further and further out.”\n",
      "Gardner predicted housing prices would grow roughly 9% in both Ada and Canyon counties by the end of 2020, continuing the trend of booming housing costs.\n",
      "Although the housing costs are rising, he said there is no indication of a bubble like the one that caused the Great Recession in 2008. Because mortgages are now harder to qualify for, only 2% to 3% of Boiseans are underwater on their mortgages; 35% of Boise homeowners have over 50% equity in their homes.However, the market will remain competitive, stemming from the influx of new residents and high construction costs due to regulation, land and material costs, and labor shortages in the construction industry.\n",
      "“Listings are going to be remarkably tight,” Gardner said. “It is still going to remain a seller's market throughout the course of this year.”\n",
      "WAGES\n",
      "Boise’s unemployment rate remains below 3%, and Gardner predicts 12,600 jobs will be added in the area by the end of 2020. He said this should result in wage growth throughout the Valley this year due to employees being able to easily find work that pays them higher rates if they are not compensated more.\n",
      "“Heads up employers, pay your employees a lot more if you want to keep them, because if you don’t they will find a job down the street,” he said.\n",
      "One of the reasons he said employers will have to raise wages is because nationwide the economy’s growth is beginning to slow down. He did not predict a recession for 2020, but Gardner said it is likely the economy will start adding jobs at a slower rate. He anticipated 1.8 million jobs will come to the U.S. economy by the end of 2020, but because of the growing workforce, he expects the nation’s unemployment rate to climb slightly by 2021.\n",
      "RELATED: Idaho economy: Slowing seen, but recession 'not likely'\n",
      "“At some point, this country has had 47 recessions and you’re going to have 47 more,” he said. “…Don’t be surprised if we see a recession in 2021, but don’t worry, it will look nothing like the Great Recession, and housing will not be a contributing factor to it.”\n",
      "He said job growth is slowly due to uncertainty in the economy from multiple factors, like ongoing trade tensions with China, the upcoming presidential election, the Coronavirus from China spreading, trade talks with Mexico and Canada as well as the question if Boeing will begin to manufacture a new type of airplane this year. (President Trump on Wednesday signed a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada into law.)\n",
      "ECONOMY\n",
      "Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 that decreased the tax burden for corporations and others in the hopes of stimulating the economy. Gardner said this did not have the desired effect of helping working class Americans and increased inequality.\n",
      "“What was supposed to happen is a thing called trickle down economics, and corporations were supposed to take those tax savings and hand them down to the employees out of the goodness of their hearts,” Gardner said. “Poppycock. The rich just got a lot richer and (the growth) did not come through. The expectation was that we'd see more economic growth, but it didn’t happen.”\n",
      "RELATED: We asked newcomers why they moved to the Treasure Valley\n",
      "America’s housing market has been riding a roller coaster since the late 1990s, he said. Either prices have been shooting through the roof, hitting the rock bottom of the burst housing bubble 10 years ago or climbing once again due to limited inventory and increased construction costs.\n",
      "He predicted the slowing growth of the economy in 2020 will be approaching a more normal period, with a 3% increase for home sales for the year. This will be the lowest rate of growth since 2012.\n",
      "“It won’t be great, but it will still be reasonable expansion,” he said. “If and when we have an economic slowdown, housing is going to be just fine.”\n",
      "The median sales price of single-family homes in Boise leaped by 75% from 2014 to late 2019, going from $172,900 to $303,100, according to a Jan. 15 report by the National Association of Realtors.\n",

      "Tweet: * Virus fears spur continued selling of risk assets * Mexican peso drops as economy shrinks in 2019 * Growth conditions in Brazil and Mexico look dim -analyst (Adds details, updates prices) By Shreyashi Sanyal and Ambar Warrick Jan 30 (Reuters) - Stocks and currencies in Latin America fell on Thursday, as a rising death toll and increased cases of the Chinese coronavirus brewed widespread fears over its economic impact. A bout of panic selling took over global financial markets as the death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus rose to 170, with more than 8,100 patients infected. Latin American assets have been hit particularly hard by the perceived demand disruptions in China, which is one of the region's largest export destinations. \"Given expectations of further escalation in the numbers of infections and deaths related to the coronavirus, anxiety, nervousness and market pessimism internationally should increase globally in the short term,\" Chetan Sehgal, lead portfolio manager at Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust, wrote in a note. The Mexican peso marked its worst drop to the dollar in more than two months, after data showed that Latin America's No. 2 economy contracted for the first time in a decade last year. Nagging uncertainty over the economic management of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has resulted in laggard business activity, a weakness that is expected to persist in 2020. Mexican stocks dropped about 0.7%. \"Growth conditions in Brazil and Mexico continue to look dim as economic momentum can at best to be said to be treading water,\" TD Securities wrote in a note. Brazil's real touched its weakest level against the dollar in two months. Stocks sank to a more-than one month low. Brazilian Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said the government will submit its administrative reform proposals to Congress \"in a week or two\" and said the government would do all that it could to pass tax reforms this year. The intended reforms are part of several promised by President Jair Bolsonaro to free up government spending and improve infrastructure. Chile's peso weakened 0.7% against the dollar, hitting levels not seen since early December. Chile's central bank held its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, as it seeks to steady a wavering economy following months of intense and often violent protests. MSCI's index for Latin American currencies fell 1%, while its index for stocks declined more than 2%. The Argentine peso and stocks were flat. The country will make an offer to creditors for the restructuring of its debt in the second week of March, with a looming presidential deadline for dealing with public debt.

      "Americans returning from Hubei province, the center of the outbreak, will be required to undergo 14 days of quarantine. Others returning from elsewhere in China will be allowed to self-monitor their condition for a similar period.\n",

      "Hours later, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines announced they were suspending all flights between the U.S. and China, joining several international carriers that have stopped flying to China as the virus outbreak continues to spread.\n",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. health officials issued a two-week quarantine order for the 195 Americans evacuated earlier this week from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. It was the first time a federal quarantine has been ordered since the 1960s, when one was enacted over concern about potential spread of smallpox, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n",
      "\"We understand this action may seem drastic. We would rather be remembered for over-reacting than under-reacting,\" the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier said. None of the Americans being housed at a Southern California military base has shown signs of illness.\n",
      "China counted 9,692 confirmed cases Friday, the vast majority in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan, where the first illnesses were detected in December.\n",
      "The National Health Commission reported 171 cases have been \"cured and discharged from hospital.\" WHO has said most people who got the illness had milder cases, though 20% experienced severe symptoms. Symptoms include fever and cough, and in severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.\n",
      "China has placed more than 50 million people in the region under virtual quarantine, while foreign countries, companies and airlines have cut back severely on travel to China and quarantined those who recently passed through Wuhan. Infected people don't show symptoms immediately and may be able to pass on the virus before they appear sick.\n",
      "American Airlines said it was halting all flights starting Friday and running through March 27. Delta plans to wait until Feb. 6 to suspend China operations to help travelers in China leave the country. It said the stoppage will continue through April 30.\n",
      "United Airlines announced that it will suspend flights to Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu but continue flights to Hong Kong.\n",
      "Since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December, at least 23 countries have reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.\n",
      "Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and WHO noted with its emergency declaration Thursday it was especially concerned that some cases abroad also involved human-to-human transmission. It defines an international emergency as an \"extraordinary event\" that poses a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.\n",
      "\"The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. \"Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.\n",
      "A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.\n",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said it was authorizing the departure of family members and all non-emergency U.S. government employees from Beijing and the consulates in the cities of Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang. Staff from the Wuhan consulate departed earlier this week.\n",
      "The decision was made \"out of an abundance of caution related to logistical disruptions stemming from restricted transportation and availability of appropriate health care,\" the embassy said.\n",
      "Mike Wester, a businessman in Beijing who has lived in China for 19 years, said he has no plans to leave.\n",
      "\"I feel safer self-quarantining myself here at home than I do risking travel,\" Wester said.\n",
      "He pointed to potential risks from crowds at airports and being required to remove a mask for passport and security checks.\n",
      "Japan and Germany also advised against non-essential travel and Britain did as well, except for Hong Kong and Macao. Popular holiday and shopping destination Singapore barred Chinese from traveling there, becoming the first Southeast Asian nation to do so.\n",
      "Tedros said WHO was not recommending limiting travel or trade to China.\n",
      "\"There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,\" he said. He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders.\n",
      "Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact, like within families, the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus is worrying.\n",
      "In Japan, a tour guide and bus driver became infected after escorting two tour groups from Wuhan. In Germany, five employees of a German auto parts supplier became ill after a Chinese colleague visited, including two who had no direct contact with the woman, who showed no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to China. On Friday, Germany confirmed a sixth case, a child of one of the people already infected.\n",
      "\"That's the kind of transmission chain that we don't want to see,\" said Marion Koopmans, an infectious diseases specialist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a member of WHO's emergency committee.\n",
      "The new virus has now infected more people globally than were sickened during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a cousin of the new virus. Both are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that can cause the common cold.\n",

Platts Analytics best-case scenario shows global jet fuel demand declining by 618,000 b/d in February, while its worst-case scenario shows a decline of 1 million b/d. In its best-case scenario, Platts Analytics assumes an almost complete shutdown of Hubei province's transport, but – significantly – little else in China's road transport, for February and March. It also assumes the aviation business will be severely curtailed in China and, to a lesser extent, the rest of Asia over the same period. In its worst-case scenario, Platts Analytics assumes the whole of China's road transport system will be vastly reduced, with up to 23% of passenger and freight trips being canceled across the country in February. It also assumes China's aviation demand will drop by an unprecedented 50% in the same period. The jet market is currently subject to a number of bearish factors. It is in a period of low demand and the upcoming refinery turnaround schedule that usually tightens the market is expected to be smaller and more spread out than usual, limiting its bullish impact. The US is well supplied with jet fuel. Inventories at 42.79 million barrels the week ending January 24 were 1.9 million barrels above the five-year average, US Energy Information Administration data shows. Oil product stocks in the Middle Eastern hub of Fujairah climbed to a five-week high Monday, led by a surge in jet fuel and other middle distillate stocks, data released Wednesday by the Fujairah Oil Inventory Zone showed. Industry experts and market analysts have recently revised down their forecasts for China's refinery throughput in February and March by 600,000 b/d to 1 million b/d, with crude oil imports set to slow down accordingly in April and May. China's gasoline demand may also register a year-on-year decline in Q1 as the central Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, is considered one of the major transportation hubs along the Changjiang River.

      "Ports in Hubei province, a major Chinese steelmaking hub, have been closed, hampering both iron ore imports and steel exports, and many cities have delayed a restart of construction until further notice. China is the world's biggest steelmaker, producing 996.3 million mt of crude steel in 2019, up 8.3% on 2018 and accounting for 53.3% of global output, a growing share, according to the World Steel Association. China's struggling auto sector is likely to take a further hit from the effects of the coronavirus. China's auto sector accounts for around 6% of the country's total steel consumption, Platts estimates. The China Iron & Steel Association has forecast that China's total steel consumption will grow by 2% this year to just under 890 million mt. The association has predicted that China's passenger car production and sales will decline by 2% this year, which would mark the third consecutive year of declines in the sector. A temporary fall in Chinese steel production and demand due to the outbreak and related restrictions could lead to higher steel production elsewhere and a buildup of inventories that may weigh down global steel prices, according to analysts at brokerage firm Jefferies. A South Korean mill source said production cuts may help Chinese mills maintain steel prices. China is the world's biggest iron ore consumer, taking more than half of seaborne supplies.\n",

It has to be pointed out that it is very regrettable that the city failed to take necessary emergency measures to prevent that many people from travelling across the country because this makes it especially difficult for the nation to prevent and control the epidemic. The city should face the fact that the public is strongly dissatisfied with this.\n",
      "At the same time, it is believed that the 5 million people did not all leave Wuhan intentionally to avoid the epidemic. Wuhan has the largest concentration of university students nationwide. It is only natural for students to leave for winter vacation. Moreover, Wuhan released a serious official notice of the disease rather late and the city didn’t start to urge people not to leave until recently. Therefore, we should not vent our anger on the people who have left Wuhan just because the outbreak of the virus started from that city. At this point, the Chinese people should look at this situation rationally.\n",
      "The most important thing at the moment is to lessen the risk posed by these 5 million people as much as possible and try to avoid this risk turning into real jeopardy.\n",
      "For this reason, the media should work to increase awareness about the situation and encourage the outflow population to notify relevant authorities of their current location of residence and proactively isolate themselves.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the entirety of Chinese society must adopt this view – investigation of the epidemic and isolation because of the disease do not equal discrimination.\n",
      "We must avoid the situation that people from the epidemic areas want to conceal their identities out of fear of being discriminated against. We also must not treat the people of Wuhan and Hubei as if they are virus spreaders regardless of where they just came from and whether they have passed the incubation period. Mutual distrust is a big taboo for disease control.\n",
      "In order to encourage high-risk groups to proactively report their situation and quarantine themselves, it is necessary to carry out supporting measures based on big data.\n",
      "We must find those people who left Wuhan in time and prevent their close contact with local residents in other parts of the country. In addition, the country must continue reducing social activities and carrying out comprehensive investigations and quarantine newly infected patients.\n",
      "Beijing’s experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003 tells us that no matter how complicated the situation is, the epidemic can be controlled as long as society is fully mobilised. What we should do now is not panic, but act resolutely and mobilise the sense of responsibility of everyone in society and truly achieve unity in the face of this epidemic. GLOBAL TIMES\n",

      "China stepped up efforts to prevent the fatal coronavirus from further spreading by coming up with guidelines for prevention and deploying community healthcare staff, which is expected to play a major role in enhancing prevention work, the national health authority said Wednesday.\n",

      "Particularly, migrant workers should be in close touch with the local community committee and report to the hospital timely if symptoms occur, Feng said.\n",
      "For instance, communities in Beijing's Fangzhuang region have designated officials to follow up with residents returning from Wuhan and monitor their physical condition, besides arranging psychologists to provide counseling to residents, said Wu Hao, director of community health service at Fangzhuang in Beijing's Fengtai district during the briefing.\n",
      "Wu particularly reiterated that Wuhan residents are not enemies, the disease is. Considering the magnitude of the situation, to contain potential sources of infection, a rational approach should be adopted, the official said.\n",
      "Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, has been in the spotlight in recent days, and residents from Wuhan have been treated differently due to growing fear of the novel coronavirus, which was also seen as an act of discrimination. Some hotels in South China's Guangdong Province reportedly refused to admit tourists from Wuhan, which sparked heated online discussions.\n",
      "\"Quarantine is aimed at curbing the spread of disease, not severing true feelings,\" Wu said, urging people to cooperate with local authorities in implementing preventive measures.\n",
      "Feng also suggested those who return from virus-hit areas should be quarantined for 14 consecutive days and their health condition should be monitored, twice every day. Besides, members of community healthcare staff are likely to contact those people to take into account the changes to their health condition.\n",

      "The news comes as the 195 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, the Hubei province city of 11 million where the outbreak originated, are undergoing three days of testing and monitoring at a Southern California military base to make sure they do not show signs of the virus.\n",

      "Tweet: Strategy Analytics: Apple Becomes World’s No.1 Smartphone Vendor in Q4 2019 Posted on January 30, 2020 BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)– $aapl #apple — According to the latest research from Strategy Analytics, global smartphone shipments held steady at zero growth to reach 375 million units in the fourth quarter of 2019. Apple grabbed first position with 19 percent global smartphone marketshare, Samsung claimed second position, while Huawei dipped to 15 percent share in third place. Full-year smartphone shipments totaled 1.4 billion units in 2019.\n",
      "Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “Global smartphone shipments grew zero percent annually from 376.0 million units in Q4 2018 to 374.5 million in Q4 2019. Worldwide smartphone demand remains mixed for now, with sharp declines in China balanced by strong growth across India and Africa. Full-year smartphone shipments hit 1.41 billion in 2019, dipping 1 percent from 1.43 billion in 2018, due to mild inventory build in the second half of the year. Looking ahead, US trade wars and the China coronavirus scare will be among barriers to growth for smartphones in 2020.”\n",
      "Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Apple iPhone shipments rose 7 percent annually from 65.9 million units worldwide in Q4 2018 to 70.7 million in Q4 2019. This was Apple’s best growth performance since 2015. Apple’s global smartphone marketshare has lifted from 18 percent to 19 percent in the past year. Apple is recovering, due to cheaper iPhone 11 pricing and healthier demand in Asia and North America. Samsung shipped 68.8 million smartphones worldwide in Q4 2019, dipping 1 percent annually from 69.3 million in Q4 2018. Samsung’s global marketshare stayed flat at 18 percent, the same level as a year ago. Samsung continues to perform relatively well across all price-bands, from the entry level to premium models such as Galaxy Note 10+ 5G. On a full-year basis, Samsung remains number one with 21 percent marketshare in 2019.”\n",
      "Woody Oh, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Huawei shipped 56.0 million smartphones worldwide in Q4 2019, sliding 7 percent annually from 60.5 million in Q4 2018. Huawei’s global marketshare has dipped from 16 percent to 15 percent in the past year. Despite strong 5G sales, Huawei is slowing at home in China and facing tougher competition abroad in key markets like Europe.”\n",
      "Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Xiaomi maintained fourth place, capturing 9 percent global smartphone marketshare in Q4 2019, up strongly from just 7 percent a year ago. Xiaomi had a great quarter in Western Europe and held steady in its biggest market India. Xiaomi is pushing hard into the 5G smartphone category and this will be a solid growth area for the vendor in 2020. OPPO held fifth position with 8 percent global smartphone marketshare during Q4 2019, staying at the same level from a year ago. OPPO is expanding hard into Western Europe, with new models like the Reno 5G, but it remains under persistent pressure from giant Huawei at home in China.” Exhibit 1: Global Smartphone Vendor Shipments and Marketshare in Q4 2019 1 Global Smartphone Shipments by Vendor (Millions of Units) Q4 ’18\n",

      "On a farm near Beijing last September, a group of conservationists put in a call to police: They’d found thousands of live birds being stored in a barn. Police seized and released the birds—about 10,000 in all—which had been caught illegally with traps and were destined for restaurants and markets in southern China. Among them were yellow-breasted buntings, critically endangered songbirds whose numbers have been in freefall, largely because people in parts of China want to eat them.\n",
      "The spread of a deadly strain of coronavirus, sourced to a wildlife market in Wuhan and now a global epidemic, has thrust China’s live wild animal trade into the spotlight. On January 26, China announced a ban on its wild animal trade until the crisis is over. Images of sick, suffering animals in markets, and videos of bats boiling alive in bowls of soup have circulated in media, sparking outrage globally and creating the impression that buying live wild animals for eating is a megascale phenomenon in China.\n",
      "The reality is more nuanced. In Guangzhou, a city of 14 million in the southeast and a frequent destination for yellow-breasted buntings, eating wildlife appears exceedingly common . In Beijing, it’s exceedingly rare .\n",
      "In reality, to many Chinese consuming wild animals is a cultural outlier. State-controlled media outlets such as China Daily have published scathing editorials denouncing the practice and calling for a permanent wildlife trade ban. These calls in turn are amplified by thousands of Chinese citizens on state-censored social media networks such as Weibo , indicating that the government seems to be letting the momentum build.\n",
      "The scale of the live wild animal trade in China is unclear, experts say. Many animals are poached, imported, and exported illegally—for food, medicine, trophies, and pets. The Chinese traditional medicine industry, which heavily relies on ancient belief in the healing powers of animal parts, is a massive driver of the trade. Demand for pangolin scales, used in traditional Chinese medicine, has made the pangolin the most heavily trafficked non-human mammal in the world.

      "The government allows 54 wild species to be bred on farms and sold for consumption, including minks, ostriches, hamsters, snapping turtles, and Siamese crocodiles. Many wild animals, such as snakes and birds of prey, are poached and brought to state-licensed farms , says Zhou Jinfeng, secretary-general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation , an NGO in Beijing that helped with the bird rescue in September. Zhou says some farmers claim that their animals were bred legally in captivity for conservation but then sell them to markets or collectors.\n",
      "It’s unknown how many live wildlife markets exist in China, but experts estimate they could number in the hundreds. For buyers, frogs are a common and inexpensive wildlife dish, says Peter Li, China policy specialist at Humane Society International and professor in East Asian politics at the University of Houston-Downtown. On the high end, Li says, only the rich can afford soup made with palm civet (a cat-size mammal native to jungles throughout Southeast Asia), fried cobra, or braised bear paw.\n",
      "Such food was not part of Li’s experience growing up. “My parents never cooked wild animals, and [we’ve] never eaten them. I’ve never had snake—much less cobra.”\n",
      "Rebecca Wong , assistant professor of sociology and behavioral sciences at the City University of Hong Kong, argues in her 2019 book about the illegal wildlife trade in China that consuming wildlife “is a common phenomenon in mainland China.” But Wong cautions against stereotyping this practice, arguing that the idea of the “Asian superconsumer” is a myth and that complex motivations are at play, including peer pressure, societal pressure, and the impulse to chase status.

      "A 2014 study that surveyed more than a thousand people in five Chinese cities found radically different practices in different parts of the country. In Guangzhou, 83 percent of people interviewed had eaten wildlife in the previous year. In Shanghai, 14 percent had, and in Beijing, just 5 percent. Nationwide, more than half the respondents said wild animals shouldn’t be eaten at all. Same city, different cultural experiences\n",
      "Charles, 22, and Cordelia, 18, are university students from the Guangzhou area, where wild animal consumption is purportedly high. I spoke with each through Instagram, where they use English names. (Both asked National Geographic not to use their last names—Instagram is banned in China, but like many young people, they use VPNs to access it.)\n",
      "Charles says eating wild animals is very common in his community, but his family doesn’t partake much, and he eats only occasionally and out of curiosity. “Nowadays, older people buy them more than younger,” he says. He thinks it’s because of education. Vendors in Beijing wear protective masks as they sell vegetables.

      "Cordelia, who lives in downtown Guangzhou, says the practice isn’t at all common in her family or community. “My friends and family don’t really like eating wild animals, and we think it’s disgusting.” She explains that she sees it as “disrespectful and a strong violation to mother nature.” She believes the ongoing epidemic may move others to see it that way too. “I think after this terrible spread of coronavirus, citizens will realise that the belief that eating wild animals is beneficial is not reliable.”\n",
      "Cordelia and Charles both support making the ban on the wild animal trade permanent, and they say they’ve seen an outpouring of support for it on Weibo.\n",
      "Cordelia’s mention that belief in health benefits drives consumption is reflected on market floors. Live animals sell for a higher price—often two to three times more—than dead ones. “People think food is more nutritious if it’s live and fresh,” Li says. “An animal may be dying, but it’s alive.” A “cauldron of contagion”\n",
      "In markets, animals “are dying, they are thirsty, they are in rusty cages and totally dirty,” Li says. They may be missing limbs or have open wounds from their capture in the wild or injuries sustained during transport. “The traders don’t handle them gently—they smash the cages down to the floor when unloading and loading. The animals suffer a lot.”\n",
      "The chaos of the trade enables the spread of zoonotic diseases—those that spread from animals to humans—says Christian Walzer, chief global veterinarian at the U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society. Wild animals, he explains, can carry viruses that “in a normal world, would not come into contact with humans.” These carriers aren’t sick—they’re simply “silent reservoirs.” But as we encroach into animals’ habitats, we increase our exposure.\n",
      "Seventy percent of zoonotic diseases come from wildlife, says Erin Sorrell , an assistant research professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C. The diseases can be notoriously devastating: HIV, Ebola, and SARS are among those that have made the leap from wildlife to humans, spawning international outbreaks.\n",
      "In wildlife markets in China and Southeast Asia, there may be 40 species—birds, mammals, reptiles—“stacked on top of each other,” Walzer says. The mixing of air and bodily secretions allows viruses to exchange, potentially creating new strains. Walzer sums it up as a “cauldron of contagion.”\n",
      "Evidence points to bats as the source of the Wuhan coronavirus. It’s unclear which species then transmitted the disease to humans, but in an assessment of the Wuhan market, the coronavirus was detected in the live wild animal section. Preventing déjà vu\n",
      "Many conservationists I spoke to believe that China’s temporary ban of the wildlife trade—which applies to all markets, grocery stores, and online sales and includes a quarantine on all breeding facilities—is likely to be largely successful. The government has set up a hotline for people to report violations. “This is an emergency situation,” Peter Li says. “Everyone is watching. Any trader who violates the ban will be reported.” On top of that, fear of coronavirus likely reduces demand—even if sellers are willing to offer live animals illegally, people may not want to buy them.\n",
      "China has resorted to a ban before. In 2003, at the height of SARS epidemic, which is believed to have originated in civets, the government issued a temporary ban on the wildlife trade. Six months later, it lifted the ban, allowing breeding facilities to resume business. Li says it’s difficult to say whether the overall live wildlife trade has grown during the past two decades, but he believes that more of the transactions have gone underground to evade law enforcement.

Today, civet soup remains a delicacy for some in China. Photograph by AFP, Getty\n",
      "There’s always the risk that this could happen again, Sorrell notes. “There’s been a 15-to-16-year gap [since SARS], but who’s to say it’s going to be another 16 years before we see the next disease emerge from a live animal market?”\n",
      "To make the temporary ban permanent, there would need to be clarification on what it actually encompasses. Some of its terms are vague, leaving them open to interpretation at the local law enforcement level. For example, does the ban include dried wildlife parts, such as bone and scales? It should, several experts tell me, but as written, it’s unclear.\n",
      "A permanent ban would face strong opposition from business interests, Li says. The State Forestry and Grassland Department, which is responsible for issuing licenses to wildlife breeders, “has long been a spokesperson for the wildlife interest,” he says. (A forestry department official had not responded to a request for comment before publication.)\n",
      "Sorrell emphasizes the need for caution in the pursuit of a permanent ban.\n",
      "“I would love to see wildlife be removed from markets, full stop,” she says. But if a ban is rushed without careful consideration, the entire wildlife trade could move underground, making it “even more dangerous for [a product] to be consumed because we’re not seeing where it’s being consumed or where it’s coming from.”\n",
      "“For any ban to be effective, it will be important to get buy-in from citizens,” adds Caroline Dingle, an evolutionary biologist in the conservation forensics lab at Hong Kong University, who studies wildlife crime. “People need to believe that consuming wild animals is bad for them personally for any ban to work long-term.”\n",
      "If a permanent ban is adopted, Li says, it would be important for the government to buy out or compensate farmers to make it possible for them to pursue a different livelihood.\n",
      "Meanwhile, for yellow-breasted buntings, verging on extinction because of recent rapid consumption, something more has to give. It’s already against the law to catch the birds, but that hasn’t slowed their trade.\n",
      "For Cordelia, the 18-year-old university student from Guangzhou, life is at a standstill. School is closed, and she can’t visit her family. Reflecting on the biological crisis that emerged from a cultural practice she can’t relate to, she says, “I believe nature gives back to us what we give to it.”\n",
      "But she draws my attention to the unity she’s seen in the wake of the crisis and the outcry on Weibo and in Chinese newspapers. “I think,” she types over Instagram, “revolutionary change is highly possible.” \n",

      "Tweet: Bank delivers Brexit-eve growth downgrades, but holds rates on signs of pick-up 1 comment The Bank of England has delivered a blow on the eve of Brexit by slashing its UK growth forecasts, but held off from cutting interest rates amid signs of a recent pick-up in the economy.\n",
      "Members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted seven to two to hold rates at 0.75%, despite recent speculation that a cut was on its way.\n",
      "The Bank revealed in its quarterly forecasts that it is expecting the economy to have flatlined at the end of last year and made a significant downgrade to the growth outlook – to 0.8% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.7% in 2022.\n",
      "It had previously predicted growth of 1.2%, 1.8% and 2% respectively. We have kept interest rates at 0.75%. Find out more in our Monetary Policy Report. https://t.co/qBs5kb9Kp3 #MonetaryPolicyReport #BankRate pic.twitter.com/jkNrJc44ek\n",

      "But it said recent survey data pointed towards a “near-term recovery” in growth after the decisive Conservative election win and easing Brexit uncertainty.\n",
      "The Bank is estimating growth will edge up to 0.2% in the first three months of 2020.\n",
      "It stressed that a rate cut could still be on the cards if growth does not recover as expected.\n",
      "Outgoing Bank governor Mark Carney said: “These are still early days and it’s less of a case of ‘so far so good’, than ‘so far good enough’.\n",
      "“It will be important for the hard data on activity to follow through on the recent pick-up in the surveys, and for domestic price inflation to strengthen.”\n",
      "He added that despite signs of stabilising growth in the wider global economy, the Bank was “watching closely” the coronavirus outbreak in China for any implications on worldwide GDP.\n",
      "“Monetary policy may need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth should the more positive signals from recent indicators of global and domestic activity not be sustained or should indicators of domestic prices remain relatively weak,” he said.\n",
      "The rates decision marks the last for Mr Carney, who is handing over the reins to Financial Conduct Authority boss Andrew Bailey on March 16.\n",
      "In his final press conference as governor, he said he “doesn’t have any regrets with monetary policy”, despite some criticism in his tenure over so-called forward guidance on rates.\n",
      "The growth forecasts will make for painful reading for the Government, coming a day ahead of Brexit on January 31. Outgoing Bank governor Mark Carney said he has no regrets from his time in charge (Chris J Ratcliffe/PA)\n",
      "The Bank’s forecasts are based on the assumption of a smooth Brexit, but cliff-edge fears have remained at the fore after Prime Minister Boris Johnson legislated against extending the transition period beyond the end of this year.\n",
      "Mr Carney said if growth does improve as predicted, then “modest” rate rises may even be needed over the next few years, though he admitted there were risks given the year-end Brexit deadline.\n",
      "The MPC minutes show that Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders remained the sole dissenters on the committee, defying expectations for more policymakers to join them in calling for a cut.\n",
      "Financial markets had at one stage priced in a more than 60% probability of a rate reduction after gloomy year-end economic data, though odds had been trimmed recently on strong UK jobs figures and more cheery sector survey results.\n",
      "Howard Archer, economist at the EY Item Club, said a rate cut still remains “very much in play”.\n",
      "But he added: “While we certainly would not rule out an interest rate cut in March, we suspect the likelihood of a rate cut reduction this year will recede as we expect economic activity to become healthier.”\n",

      "After Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock earned a Wedbush price target of $400, analyst Dan Ives’ $2 trillion valuation seems not entirely far-fetched. The stock already rose by over 100% in the last year, so another $100 added to its share price could be inevitable. Source: pio3 / Shutterstock.com\n",
      "For Apple stock to reach the $400 level, the company needs exceptionally strong demand growth for its iPhone devices. The company is already there — as the latest quarterly results indicate. And the 5G refresh cycle, which is already underway with Apple’s competitors, must drive more device upgrades.\n",
      "Before predicting the sales strength on a product that is not out yet, investors should start by breaking down Apple’s quarterly earnings report posted on Jan. 28. Exceptionally Strong First-Quarter Results\n",
      "Apple reported revenue growing an impressive 9% from last year. This is an all-time record and is in stark contrast with last year’s worries. Previously, Apple removed iPhone unit sales numbers from its quarterly report. In doing so, it forced analysts and the markets to consider its other revenue numbers.\n",
      "Not only did iPhone sales of $56 billion exceed the $51.4 billion consensus estimate, but Apple also sold almost $6 billion worth of iPads, $7.2 billion Macs and $10 billion worth of wearables and home accessories. Services revenue was $12.7 billion. The company highlighted in its press release that it returned $25 billion to shareholders in the first quarter. Stock buybacks worth $20 billion and $3.5 billion in dividend payments are in line with rewarding shareholders. Outlook for Q2\n",
      "Apple forecast revenue between $63 billion and $67 billion and gross margins between 38% and 39%. The wider range is due to the company forecasting the potential impact of the coronavirus on the business. For example, if retail traffic falls sharply as those in China stay inside and avoid travel, it may hurt Apple’s production rate. In Q1, it had over 480 million paid subscriptions. So, Apple will soon exceed its 500 million target set for the March quarter.\n",
      "Getting to the new target of 600 million subscribers by the end of this year is inevitable. Apple Store revenue grew in the double-digit range in Q1. And as third-party subscriptions take off, the company should expect another year of strong services revenue.\n",
      "The beauty of Apple’s forecast including the risks of the virus in China is that it has mitigation plans in place. This will make up for any production loss. Still, if Apple reopens its factories after Chinese New Year on Feb. 10, output should reach expected levels. Apple TV+ and 5G Are Not Yet Meaningful\n",
      "Given that Apple is still in the early phases of the Apple TV+ launch, the service is not adding meaningfully to revenue just yet. But as it counts more paid subscribers, Apple TV+ bundle subscribers and free subscribers, the larger audience will attract more talent and original content.\n",
      "Recently, analysts speculated that an iPhone 5G refresh cycle would drive sales even higher. But on its conference call, an analyst asked how Apple would price 5G models. The analyst asked:\n",
      "“There is a general view that when 5G phones come out they’re going to be more expensive due to higher component costs , but at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low cost geographies to phones like iPhone SE. So, how do you see these two different segments within the smartphone market evolving over the next one to three years?\n",
      "CEO Tim Cook responded by saying he will not comment on future products. Instead, he hinted at a 5G product in Apple’s product roadmap. But he said he would not comment on the pricing of something that is not yet announced. Compare Brokers Valuation and My Takeaway on Apple Stock\n",
      "Investors may forecast Apple growing revenue in the mid-single digits for the next five years. In a discounted cash flow model: earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) exit, assume the following: Metrics\n",

      "Tweet: The coronavirus epidemic in China is far more than a disease; it is the most serious challenge to the rule of President Xi Jinping and the direction he has taken China since he assumed power in 2012. The stakes are extraordinarily high. It is far too early to predict the beginning of the end of Xi’s political career, but the epidemic clearly is shaking China and Xi’s way of governance to its core.\n",
      "Since the Chinese revolution of 1949 , the central tension inside the country’s Communist Party has been between “reds” and “experts,” between ideology and know-how. This tension has real world significance. During the Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957, as many as 650,000 Chinese intellectuals (or “experts”) were sent to China’s gulags because they were not sufficiently “red.” The Great Leap Forward marked the climax of red economic policies and resulted in death by starvation of some 30 million Chinese. The Cultural Revolution that took place between 1966 and 1976 saw millions more educated Chinese murdered by gangs loyal to party chairman Mao Zedong, the chief red of them all.\n",
      "After Mao died, Deng Xiaoping ended the Cultural Revolution and reappointed experts to many positions throughout China. Deng put China on the road toward economic modernization. There was an uneasy truce between reds and experts. Redness did raise its ugly head, such as on June 4, 1989, when Deng ordered the People’s Liberation Army to crush pro-democracy demonstrations throughout China, killing hundreds.\n",
      "AD AD Still, the general trend in China was to favor the experts. At one point during the 2000s, all seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the most powerful political body in the country, were engineers, a clear sign that, in China, the experts were in charge. In addition, throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, China’s government, specifically the State Council and the Office of the Premier, grew increasingly strong, taking more responsibility for critical issues such as the economy and reforms of state-owned enterprises. The Chinese Communist Party was still all-powerful, of course, but the government was strengthening, as well.\n",
      "Xi reversed those trends when he rose to power . He gutted the power of the government by expanding the number of “leading groups” within the party, which monopolized decision-making. It was no coincidence that he appointed himself chairman of most of those groups, including ones that oversaw economic reform, foreign affairs, internal security, innovation and technology.\n",
      "In 2018, Xi effectively declared himself president for life , blowing up the architecture of political succession that had been constructed by Deng. Xi also launched a withering campaign against Western ideology, even ordering censors to remove books from the libraries of Chinese universities if their content was not sufficiently red. When Robert Zoellick, the then-president of the World Bank, asked Xi what his priorities were for China’s future development, Xi replied , “the 86.68 million members of the Communist Party.” In Xi’s mind, better red than expert.\n",
      "AD AD But the coronavirus has challenged the system Xi has built like nothing else has.\n",
      "Xi has been forced to bow to the experts. In a move unprecedented from a man who has sought, as the Chinese say, to become “chairman of everything,” last week, Xi appointed his formerly knee-capped premier Li Keqiang to head the leading group in charge of dealing with the virus. It was Li, not Xi, who went to the virus’s ground zero in Wuhan to supervise the campaign against it.\n",
      "Why did Xi permit Li to move out from under his shadow? For one, unlike Xi, Li is an expert. He has dealt with epidemics. Not once, but twice. According to Ryan Manuel, a Hong Kong-based political analyst, Li was at the helm in Henan province at the tail end of a scandal during which thousands of Chinese who sold their blood contracted HIV . In 2003, during the severe SARS epidemic, Manuel noted, Li disciplined 800 officials in Henan to enforce health measures designed to fight the disease — far more than any of his counterparts in other provinces. Chinese netizens have hinted at a second reason. “At the critical moment,” a user wrote on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter , “the person who heads a lot of leading groups is absent.” The post soon disappeared. Xi, of course, might be setting up Li as the fall guy in case the party doesn’t get the virus under control.\n",
      "AD AD The best chronology to date on the path of the coronavirus, written by a Chinese reporter in Wuhan , underscores the tragic results of this battle between China’s red and experts. Within weeks after the virus first appeared on Dec. 8, researchers in both Beijing and Shanghai sequenced the coronavirus genome and confirmed the origin of the disease. Quickly, the chronology noted, China’s experts developed test reagents and distributed them to provincial centers for disease control throughout China. This was fast, professional work and it was shared with the World Health Organization.\n",
      "At the same time, however, China’s reds were less forthcoming with China’s people than its experts were with the WHO. Instead of fighting the virus, the apparatchiks who take their orders from Party leaders were obfuscating, suppressing news of the virus and threatening with prosecution those who tried to break the information logjam.\n",
      "On Dec. 30, the chronology notes, the Wuhan Health Commission issued an order to hospitals, clinics and other health-care units prohibiting the release of any information about treatment of this new disease. On each day between Jan. 12 and Jan. 16, the Wuhan Municipal Health Construction Commission announced that there were no new cases and no close contacts involving the virus. Meanwhile, the virus raged.\n",
      "AD AD As the reporter noted, “Politics first. Stability preservation first.” This is Xi’s system. And now all of China — and perhaps Xi himself — will have to deal with its consequences.\n",

      "NEW YORK (AP) - Health officials Thursday reported the first U.S. case of person-to-person spread of the new virus from China.\n",
      "The man is married to the Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. There have been cases reported of the infectious virus spreading to others in a household or workplace in China and elsewhere.\n",
      "The new case is the sixth reported in the United States. The other five were travelers who developed the illness after returning to the U.S. from China. The latest patient had not been in China.\n",
      "The Chicago woman returned from central China on Jan. 13, then last week went to a hospital with symptoms and was diagnosed with the viral illness. She and her husband, both in their 60s, are hospitalized.\n",
      "Experts have said they expected additional cases, and that at least some limited spread of the disease in the United States was likely. Health officials think the new virus spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads.\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Illinois health officials said that health workers and people who have been in contact with the latest patient are being monitored for symptoms.\n",
      "“We anticipated this,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. “The kind of contact that you have in a household is very close and very prolonged. That’s the kind of circumstance where we would anticipate a virus such as this could be transmitted.\"\n",
      "The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. It is a member of the coronavirus family that&apos;s a close cousin to the SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past. The new virus has sickened thousands, mostly in China, and killed about 170.\n",
      "An international outbreak caused by the virus first emerged last month in China. Doctors there began seeing the new virus in people who got sick after spending time at a wholesale food market in Wuhan. Officials said the virus probably initially spread from animals to people, as did SARS and MERS.\n",
      "The other U.S. cases are in Arizona, Southern California and Washington state.\n",

      "Tweet: Over the past two decades, three novel coronaviruses — SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2002, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) in 2012 and now 2019-nCoV — have emerged, with both health and economic consequences around the globe.\n",
      "Before SARS, coronaviruses were known to be one of the causes of the common cold. Although they can cause severe illness in higher-risk groups such as newborns, the elderly and those with underlying health conditions , they typically cause mild disease in healthy adults.\n",
      "The emergence of SARS was the first indication that coronaviruses could cause more severe illness in otherwise healthy adults, with the virus infecting the lower reaches of the lungs. MERS has also caused epidemics of pneumonia and systemic disease since 2012.\n",
      "We are currently seeing an outbreak of a third coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia, shifting the global perspective on coronaviruses and their potential to cause a greater range of illness. As the public looks for information and scientists rush for answers, advances in social media and technology have offered some good, some bad and some ugly pockets of information. Rapid progress\n",
      "The world is not the same as it was in 2002 when SARS emerged. Social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, have allowed the rapid exchange of information — and sometimes misinformation. Many of the cutting-edge technologies and techniques scientists use today to analyze big data did not exist in 2002 either.\n",
      "The World Health Organization was alerted of a pneumonia cluster on Dec. 31, which appeared to be linked to a single market in Wuhan, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market . Chinese scientists rapidly isolated the virus and sequenced its genome using a cutting-edge technology called next generation sequencing.\n",
      "Next generation sequencing allows scientists to rapidly determine the genetic code of an organism. It detects all variations or mutations in the genome, which may provide scientists with clues on mutation rates, the source of the virus, and its pattern of circulation within a population.\n",
      "By Jan. 10, the first genetic code describing the building blocks of this virus became publicly available. Some early analyses suggested the virus originated in snakes . Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology subsequently reported the virus was a SARS-like coronavirus that had likely originated in bats: the sequence of the virus was about 96 per cent identical to a bat coronavirus .\n",
      "Knowing that 2019-nCoV is a SARS-like virus has allowed scientists to infer important information about how the virus is transmitted from one person to another, and how it binds to, and enters, cells to produce numerous copies of itself, a process called replication.\n",
      "Importantly, the sequence of the viral genome also allows scientists to begin designing and synthesizing viral proteins for vaccine development.\n",
      "With the sequence available, a great number of researchers with a larger array of tools are able to work on vaccines and antivirals for this immediate viral threat. With the use of Twitter, Skype, WhatsApp and bioRxiv ( a website where scientists can upload their scientific papers for public review ), clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians (biologists who work with big data) and epidemiologists from around the world have focused and co-ordinated their efforts to fight the outbreak and contain its spread. Specifically, scientists are using Twitter to brainstorm and provide ideas that help advance research on 2019-nCoV. Getting good information\n",
      "To date, the 2019-nCoV has spread to 18 countries and territories, with the greatest burden in China. So far, there have been 132 deaths and 6,065 confirmed cases worldwide, including two confirmed cases in Toronto and one in British Columbia. But this is a rapidly evolving and fluid situation and these numbers are likely now out of date.\n",
      "Some modellers are predicting there may be as many as 100,000 cases . If true, it may suggest the virus can cause a very mild illness as well as severe, which would lead to a high number of unreported cases.\n",
      "The first descriptions of the virus said it was not being transmitted from one person to another. Reports now indicate that sustained human-to-human transmission is occurring .\n",
      "Media reports have suggested that virus transmission might occur during the incubation period of 2019-nCoV infection, though this has yet to be definitively confirmed and has been met with some skepticism. These confounding assessments have created an aura of apprehension in the information being presented on this emerging epidemic.\n",
      "Canadians should look to their provincial health agencies and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) for reliable, accurate information and direction. PHAC is working with the WHO to monitor the situation and give Canadians direction.\n",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019-nCoV appears to spread mainly through close contact and by respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The WHO’s recommendations to reduce exposure to their virus include frequent hand-washing, covering mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing and avoiding close contact with anyone with a fever or cough. Staying calm\n",
      "At this point in the epidemic, we are still in a dynamic phase where scientists are learning in real time how a newly emerged virus behaves and circulates across populations. It will take time to produce the reliable information required for a detailed analysis of the dynamics of 2019-nCoV transmission and spread.\n",
      "Scientists, epidemiologists, clinicians and data modellers need to complete accurate analyses and controlled experiments that will allow us to produce an appropriate understanding of this virus’ specific behaviour and the similarities and differences it shares with other coronaviruses.\n",
      "It’s important that we listen to our public health agencies to get concise information for keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from both disease and panic.\n",

With initial symptoms that resemble other diseases, many people are wondering how to know whether to seek medical help.\n",
      "With the new coronavirus now in the US, am I at risk?\n",
      "The biggest risk factors for being infected with the new coronavirus are travel to China, particularly Wuhan and other areas of Hubei Province, and close contact with a person who has a suspected or confirmed n-CoV case. Without those risk factors, the chance for the general American public of catching this virus is low.\n",
      "However, the outbreak is rapidly changing, and it is unclear how the situation in the U.S. will evolve in upcoming weeks.\n",
      "What are the symptoms of 2019 n-CoV?\n",
      "Most cases of 2019 n-CoV have had fever and signs of pneumonia, like cough or shortness of breath. In some cases people are not able to breathe on their own and require the use of a ventilator. A small percentage of people die.\n",
      "What should I do if I have any of these symptoms?\n",
      "If you experience any of these symptoms within 14 days of travel to China, or within 14 days of coming in close contact with an individual infected with the coronavirus, you should immediately call your health care provider. It is best to call ahead before going to a clinic or emergency room.\n",
      "Your health care provider will evaluate you with the help of your state’s public health department and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If your travel history and reported symptoms fit with n-CoV infection, you may be tested for the virus. Right now that test can be performed only at the CDC, so your health care provider would send samples to the CDC for testing.\n",
      "What else could it be?\n",
      "At this time of year many respiratory viruses are circulating in the community, including influenza, RSV, rhinovirus and human coronaviruses, which are different from the 2019 n-CoV virus. It is much more likely that you have one of these viruses than the 2019 n-CoV virus, even if you have traveled to China.\n",
      "So there are other coronaviruses?\n",
      "Yes. There are four human coronaviruses that circulate each year in the U.S. They cause 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract illnesses in the U.S., with mild symptoms akin to the common cold. Health care labs can test for these coronaviruses – but not for 2019 n-CoV.\n",

      "Tweet: Viral Outbreaks Are Here to Stay. This is How Humans Will Fight Back Alice Park Reblog The year of the rat is off to an ominous start. “We just stay home and don’t go out,” says Mr. Dong. The 33-year-old researcher, who provided only one name, has no other options. He, his wife and their 3-month-old daughter live in Wuhan, the epicenter of an unfolding global health crisis. They’re treating the forced time at home as a holiday, though he says, “this is different than any of them before.” Families like his huddle in their homes, fearful that if they venture out, they will get sick. Since the first cases of a previously unknown pneumonia-like illness emerged in December , Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, has frozen in place. Ten-lane thoroughfares lie empty after a ban on personal cars, and buses and subways sit silent. Lunar New Year 2020 was stripped of its traditional fireworks, boisterous gatherings around overflowing tables of food and drink, and happy reunions with family and friends. As researchers and public-health officials scramble to learn as much as they can about the new virus—how easily it transmits among people, and how deadly it is—fears swamp this city of 11 million. The disease responsible is caused by a coronavirus that’s never infected people before. Conflicting advice about how infectious the virus might be are swirling through the Internet, along with misinformation about exactly where the virus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, came from. Hospitals in Wuhan are besieged by the sick, and only a handful of clinics are able to test for the disease. Coronaviruses make up a family of viruses that live mainly in animals (bats are a favorite) but also includes strains that contribute to the common cold in people. Only recently have they become more threatening, causing two deadly global pandemics in the past two decades— severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS ) in 2002 and 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. Each new outbreak adds a fresh urgency to the question of whether public-health officials could be doing more to confront the threat from emerging infections in general, and coronaviruses in particular. The numbers will have climbed by the time you read this, but as of Jan. 29, the new virus had claimed at least 133 lives and sickened more than 6,000 people across 18 countries, including at least five cases in the U.S. While the World Health Organization (WHO) has not declared a “public-health emergency of international concern”—which would entail more stringent monitoring and containment of infected people— China’s President Xi Jinping is treating it as a national emergency. He ordered an unprecedented quarantine of Wuhan, banning travel in and out of the city on Jan. 22; a few days later, he extended the quarantine to a dozen cities in Hubei province. Xi also took the unusual step of extending the official Lunar New Year holiday to discourage millions from traveling back to work and further seeding new infections around China. Faster than the virus itself, fear has spread around the globe. In the U.S., designated airports quickly instituted screening programs to identify passengers on Wuhan-originating flights with signs of fever, cough or difficulty breathing, and to immediately direct them to hospital isolation wards. Numerous airlines canceled flights to and from China. Asian stock markets that weren’t closed for the Lunar New Year plummeted. In the U.S., Europe and Asia, shortages of surgical face masks were reported. The emergence of a powerful new infectious virus for which there is (as yet) no vaccine should scare us, of course. But at the same time, humans are better equipped to fight these kinds of outbreaks than ever before. New technologies, specifically ones that make possible the sequencing of any living thing’s genetic blueprint, are finally giving us a meaningful advantage over microbes. We can map the genome of a virus, for example, which provides valuable clues about how it spreads and helps us figure out how our immune systems can best battle it. The finest scientific minds are doing just that with coronaviruses in the hope that epidemics do not have a chance to mushroom into pandemics. The question now is how quickly we can transmit that knowledge to every corner of the world, especially to China, where in some places the flow of information is tightly controlled by a paranoid state. Researchers in London and Hong Kong have already warned that Beijing has dramatically underestimated the number of cases in Wuhan. “For any disease outbreak, the best strategy is transparency,” says Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the New York City—based Council on Foreign Relations. “Even taking into account the potential for panic, you need people to be prepared.” With a government as opaque as China’s, can we be sure that we are? Coronaviruses are not rare. In fact, you might have one right now. Depending on the year, anywhere from 10% to 30% of the annual burden of colds can be blamed on one of four coronaviruses. That’s why, until the early 2000s, the scientific community treated coronaviruses primarily as nuisances and paid relatively little attention to them. “Twenty years ago, people weren’t thinking in terms of coronaviruses being potential causes of pandemics or respiratory disease,” says Dr. Ian Lipkin, director of the center for infection and immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. That changed in 2002, when SARS first emerged from China. Of the 8,000 people ultimately confirmed to have the respiratory disease, up to 10% died, waking public-health experts to the dangers of a virus that had jumped from bats to cats and dogs, and then to people. In Wuhan, officials believe 2019-nCoV made such a leap inside the city’s Huanan market. Rows of blue stalls housed countless purveyors of exotic, wild animals for consumption. “I saw live hedgehogs, porcupines, that kind of thing,” says Alan Laine, 57, a physics teacher from the U.K. who has lived in Wuhan since 2002. “It wasn’t exactly hidden.” The market has been shuttered since Jan. 1, though officials in white hazmat suits continued to sift through evidence when TIME visited on Jan. 22. Movement across species is what makes virus experts nervous. Because of their sloppy genetic copying, viruses mutate all the time. By chance, the new aberrations sometimes make a strain more adept at living in a new host—and in some cases, those changes make it more virulent as well. In some respects, the outbreak in Wuhan might have been inevitable. Ralph Baric, professor of epidemiology at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an expert on the genetic sequences of coronaviruses, has worked with Chinese researchers since 2002 to better understand this family of microbes and how its members infect human cells to cause major respiratory symptoms. From bats, Baric and his team extracted a series of coronaviruses that varied genetically from SARS by anywhere from 2% to 12%. Those differences hinted that some were primed to jump from bats to people, and cause serious disease. His findings should have rung alarm bells, he says. “We made strong predictions that these coronaviruses were poised for re-emergence in human populations.” In December, that prediction came true, when a mysterious pneumonia-like illness began spreading in the city of Wuhan. It’s not a mystery how authorities should respond to a new infectious disease; by and large, it’s been the same for thousands of years. Since typhoid fever struck Athens in 430 B.C.—among the first recorded outbreaks—to the black plague in Europe during the 1300s, and the more contemporary 1918 influenza pandemic, isolation and quarantine have been the most effective ways to contain a highly contagious infectious agent and prevent it from decimating an entire population of people. Yet in China, those lessons weren’t always followed, despite the recent legacy of SARS. Although scientists in China quickly identified the new coronavirus, public-health officials were slow to advise people about how best to protect themselves. It took President Xi nearly a month after the first cases emerged in Wuhan to finally address the health crisis publicly, and local health officials say that delay tied their hands. As Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang explained on CCTV on Jan. 27, “As a local official, I could only disclose information after being authorized [by the central government]. A lot of people don’t understand this.” Indeed, the wife of a doctor in a Wuhan hospital told TIME that her husband had been instructed not to discuss the coronavirus situation and the government’s response with anyone. The top-down leadership structure of Xi’s government leaves local health departments with little authority to issue alerts or take any action, snarling public health and politics at the expense of human lives. Train conductors were reportedly initially told not to wear masks to avoid generating more panic among passengers, just days before the entire rail system was shut down. “People didn’t realize the severity of the situation,” says a graphic designer from Wuhan who provided only her last name, Tao. “They thought the virus was controllable and not contagious. The government did not publish the facts in time, and they failed to control the epidemic.” The swing from downplaying the initial cases to the extreme policies now in place fueled outbursts on the social-media network Weibo: “The common people are suffering. We don’t really have democracy here, and we are deprived of the right of telling the truth,” wrote one Weibo user on Jan. 28. Another, on the same day, went further, seeing the outbreak as a harbinger of the future of the Chinese state. “The virus outbreak exposes the truth. It is a wake-up call: our country is not as strong as we expected, our system is not as superior as TV describes.” Xi’s government has done at least one indisputably effective thing to help battle the virus. On Jan. 10, it posted online a scientific paper containing the genetic blueprint of 2019-nCoV. The prompt release of the sequence won Xi plaudits in the global health community, since it allowed teams around the world to begin breaking down the ingredients of the infection and figuring out how to fight it. When SARS hit, the sequencing of the human genome was costly and cumbersome; in part because of that, in 2002, it took the Beijing government five months to release what it did in just a few days in 2020. Today, the technology is cheap and routine and is already speeding detection of new cases. When the first potential case of 2019-nCoV appeared in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was able to confirm the fingerprint of the new coronavirus overnight, from the patient’s sample sent to the agency. The CDC also plans to ship testing kits to health departments, both in the U.S. and abroad, to enable them to quickly confirm coronavirus infections and distinguish them from the current seasonal flu. Diagnosing a disease is one thing, but treating it is another, and creating a vaccine or drug will take longer. To find out exactly which proteins the virus is using to wreak havoc requires making high-quality synthetic DNA from the viral genome, something only a few companies are able to do in a process that takes around 10 days. Then researchers need to make proteins from that DNA. Without those proteins from the viral genome, you can’t test which antibodies or drug compounds might counteract them. “The [genetic] code on a screen doesn’t get you things to work with on the bench,” says Karla Satchell, co-director of the center for structural genomics of infectious diseases at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. Scientists shouldn’t be relying on private companies in this way, says Andrew Mesecar, a coronavirus researcher and head of biochemistry at Purdue University, who researches coronaviruses. He is currently working on a solution: he and his team have studied the proteins, or enzymes, that different strains of coronavirus use to replicate in human cells, and developed 50 compounds that can inhibit their activity, essentially blocking the virus from causing infection. “My idea is to have an [IBM] Watson of drug discovery,” he says. “As soon as we get the sequence information for a new disease-causing virus, I can feed the computer the information, and it will say you should try these compounds off the shelf to start. It’s not here yet, but it’s coming, and I hope this is realized in my lifetime.” Yet even if researchers identify a potential drug for 2019-nCoV, testing its safety and efficacy will take months. To speed that process up, scientists are tapping some new technologies. For example, stem cells can be coaxed to churn out high volumes of human lung cells in order to study how a virus like 2019-nCoV interacts with them. And three-dimensional cell cultures, which mimic in a lab dish the physical and molecular environment in the human body, could substitute for some early human safety studies, making for a more affordable and efficient way to test how safe a treatment might be. Advances like these make some in the field hopeful that the public-health response could be better this time around. “Twitter and everything was lighting up on Friday night [Jan. 10] that the genetic sequence of the virus was posted,” says Mesecar. “We analyzed the first one that Saturday morning. Within 20 minutes of having the sequence, I knew it was very close to SARS. That’s when I thought, ‘Uh-oh, this could be as virulent as SARS.’ That tells you right away that you had better act like this is SARS.” There is still a lot about the Wuhan coronavirus that researchers don’t know, however. It’s not clear how easily the virus spreads from person to person or how long its incubation period is, and there are reports from Chinese health officials that it can be spread by someone who is infected but doesn’t have any symptoms of the illness. The CDC and other health agencies are trying to confirm that right now. Both U.S. and Chinese scientists are also working on developing a vaccine for 2019-nCoV, relying on some of the genetic knowledge they gathered from SARS. All the science in the world still might not be a match for human nature, however, as personal fears often take precedence over the public good—especially during an unfolding outbreak when health officials don’t have all the answers. When Jacob Wilson, who runs a media company in Wuhan, first felt his throat get scratchy on Jan. 21, he wasn’t concerned. The 33-year-old from Alexandria, La., hadn’t visited the seafood market that was being targeted as the source of the outbreak, and health authorities in Wuhan said the new mysterious pneumonia-like illness wasn’t passed between humans. Reassured, Wilson continued going to work. “But for the next three days I had a fever and dry cough, which turned into an upper-respiratory infection, sneezing, runny nose and then muscle soreness, weakness and sharp pains throughout my chest,” he says. Unsure whether he was infected with 2019-nCoV or the flu, he decided to wait it out rather than brave a potentially infectious line of people at the hospital for several hours. “It just seemed absolutely terrifying and unsafe,” he says. Even if he had gone to the hospital, he might not have learned if he had 2019-nCoV; only four medical centers in the entire city had kits to test for the virus at the time. He turned instead to his mother, a nurse in the U.S., who prescribed antiviral and asthma medications that improved his symptoms after about a week. He and the roughly 50 million people stuck in Hubei province are still facing a quarantine period that looks likely to drag into weeks and possibly months, as the numbers of infections and deaths creep higher. With workplaces shuttered, and no way to earn money, locals are counting their meals—and trying to remain positive. “This break is peace and quiet,” says Dong. “People may feel bored, but I enjoy this holiday.” Until science offers a better remedy, the people of Wuhan must cling to those simplest of defenses: hope and hiding. \n",

      "Tweet: Scientists are starting to fill in some key gaps in what's known about the new virus from China. New research suggests it spreads a little easier than regular flu but not as well as some other respiratory diseases like whooping cough or tuberculosis.\n",
      "Health officials are focusing on person-to-person spread as the virus extends its geographic reach. Nearly 8,000 cases have been confirmed in China, while a much smaller number of people have been reported in more than a dozen other countries.\n",
      "WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE VIRUS?\n",
      "The new virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. In 2002, one called SARS caused an outbreak of severe pneumonia in China and spread to other countries. It infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 until it was controlled by some of the same public health measures being used in the current outbreak.\n",
      "In 2012, another coronavirus dubbed MERS began sickening people in Saudi Arabia. It still causes small numbers of infections each year. The World Health Organization has counted nearly 2,500 cases in the Middle East and beyond, and more than 850 deaths.\n",
      "The new virus is 75% to 80% identical to SARS, scientists have reported. So far, about 8,000 infections have been confirmed, nearly all in China. About 170 deaths have occurred. Its true mortality rate isn't known, because many infections may be going undetected in people who have mild or no symptoms.\n",
      "HOW EASILY DOES IT SPREAD?\n",
      "Based on the first 425 cases analyzed, each infected person spread the virus to 2.2 others on average, scientists reported Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. That's a bit more than ordinary flu but far less than some other respiratory diseases such as whooping cough and tuberculosis. The rate for SARS was estimated to be 3.\n",
      "On Thursday, officials reported the first U.S. case of person-to-person spread — the husband of a Chicago woman who had travelled to Wuhan, China.\n",
      "The rate of spread is a key factor in bringing outbreaks under control. It's the reason health officials are focused on finding and isolating new cases and checking on people in close contact with them.\n",
      "It's not known whether anyone who is infected but not showing symptoms can spread the virus. But at a news conference earlier this week, the U.S. government's infectious diseases chief, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said outbreaks are not driven by that kind of spread.\n",
      "WHERE DO THESE VIRUSES COME FROM?\n",
      "SARS and MERS came from animals, and this newest virus almost certainly did, too. The first people infected had visited or worked at a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. In the New England Journal report on the first 425 confirmed cases, Chinese scientists said that 55% of those before Jan. 1 were tied to that market but only 8% of cases after that were.\n",
      "SARS initially was traced to civet cats sold in a live animal market, but later scientists decided it probably originated in bats that infected the civets. People can catch MERS from infected camels, although again, bats likely first spread that coronavirus to camels.\n",
      "Scientists have said the new virus seems similar genetically to some bat viruses, but it's not known if that is the source in nature or if another animal may be involved.\n",
      "HOW DOES IT SPREAD? WHO'S MOST AT RISK?\n",
      "Unlike SARS, the new virus \"looks like it doesn’t transmit through the air very easily and probably transmits through close contact,” said Dr. David Heymann, who headed WHO’s global response to SARS.\n",
      "And while it's too soon to be sure, Heymann said the new virus appears most dangerous to older adults who have other health problems.\n",
      "Few of the early cases occurred in children, and more than half were in adults 60 and older, the New England Journal report this week says.\n",
      "IT’S FLU SEASON IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE — HOW WILL PEOPLE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE?\n",
      "Since symptoms are similar — fever, cough and in more severe cases shortness of breath or pneumonia — it takes a medical test to tell. There is one, but health authorities in China, the U.S. and elsewhere are working to make it more widely available.\n",
      "Given that it is flu season in China, too, it's “all the more impressive that they were able to recognize this outbreak quickly,” Dr. Brian Garibaldi of Johns Hopkins University said.\n",
      "The average incubation period — from infection until symptoms show up — is about five days, the New England Journal study says. However, symptoms have turned up much later, supporting the wisdom of a two-week observation time, the authors wrote.\n",
      "HUNTING VACCINES\n",
      "While there is no vaccine — or specific treatment — for SARS or MERS, Fauci said it is technically possible to create a vaccine against this new virus. NIH did develop a potential vaccine candidate for SARS. It proved safe in a small first-step study in people but never was tested further because by then, the outbreak was ending.\n",
      "This time around, scientists have more of a head start. Just weeks after the first unusual pneumonias were reported, Chinese scientists mapped the genes of the viral suspect and shared them with world health authorities.\n",
      "Now, NIH is among several groups working to create a vaccine for the new virus, using newer and faster technology than was available during SARS. Fauci hopes to begin first-step safety tests in about three months, but something ready for real-world use would take far longer.\n",

The virus has spread from the epicentre of Wuhan to more that 15 countries, with about 60 cases in Asia, Europe, North America and, most recently, the Middle East. World Athletics said they had considered the possibility of relocating the event to another country but \"given concerns still exist regarding the spread of the virus outside China, we have decided not to go with this option, as it may lead to further postponement at a later date\". \"We would like Nanjing to be the host given the extensive planning and preparation they have put into this event. \"We have chosen not to cancel the championships as many of our athletes would like this event to take place so we will now work with our athletes, our partners and the Nanjing organising committee to secure a date in 2021 to stage this event.\" Earlier Wednesday, World Cup skiing races in the Chinese resort of Yanqing, the first test events for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, were cancelled because of the outbreak. The men's downhill and super-G races were scheduled for February 15 and February 16 in Yanqing, 70 kilometres (45 miles) northwest of Beijing.

But the president was conspicuously quiet about one big issue that has much of the globe on pins and needles: the spread of a deadly new type of coronavirus. A self-described germaphobe, Trump has had little to say in public about the new virus that so far has killed more than 170 people in China, sickened thousands more there and led to a handful of confirmed cases in the U.S. And he speaks in broad terms when he does talk about it. “We're very much involved with them, right now, on the virus that's going around,” Trump said of China before signing a trade deal at the White House on Wednesday. He said he had discussed the situation with Chinese President Xi Jinping and added, “We're working very closely with China.” Aides and confidants say Trump's careful approach is part of a political strategy crafted to avoid upsetting the stock market or angering China by calling too much attention to the virus or blaming Beijing for not managing the situation better, according to a White House official and a Republican close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted out photos from a briefing on the virus he attended with administration officials in the Situation Room, writing that “we have the best experts anywhere in the world and they are on top of it 24/7!” In keeping with the low-profile approach, the White House announced by email Wednesday night that the meeting included members of a task force that will lead the US response to the new virus. The 12-person team is chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and coordinated through the National Security Council. The president's comments contrast sharply with the fierce criticism he lobbed at his predecessor, President Barack Obama, during the 2014-15 Ebola crisis, which left more than 11,000 dead in three West African nations. At the time, Trump ripped into Obama as a “dope” and “incompetent&quot; and called for a travel ban on visitors from Ebola-infected countries. Trump also advocated preventing infected American health care workers from coming home for treatment. Obama faced some criticism from public health officials for being slow to address the Ebola crisis initially, but also received plaudits for eventually attacking it with vigor. He nudged Congress to make a USD 5.4 billion emergency appropriation to aid the fight and sent 3,000 US troops to West Africa to help with the international response. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said he's taken a measure of comfort in the fact that Trump, so far, hasn't overreacted and has resisted “fanning the flames” as he did with his rhetoric during the Ebola crisis. That leaves room, Gostin said, for public health professionals to take the lead. &quot;As long as that continues and as long as there isn't political interference or mass quarantines in the U.S. or outright travel bans, I will feel comfortable with how the White House is handling it,” Gostin said. He added that he'd like to see Trump ask Congress for a $1 billion emergency appropriation to help agencies battling to contain the virus. Trump is well aware the virus outbreak in China could create a wild card for the US economy during an election year. And he has long prioritized the US economic relationship with China, especially during trade negotiations, and similarly largely held his tongue during widespread protests in Hong Kong. He also takes enormous pride in the personal relationship he's developed with Xi and has commended him for demonstrating “transparency&quot; as he deals with the crisis. Trump said “we have it totally under control” when he was asked about the new type of coronavirus while in Switzerland last week to attend an economic conference. And in a separate Twitter posting, he offered reassurance but scant detail for his confidence.Get \n",

      "Boosting efforts to fight pneumonia could avert nearly 9 million child deaths this decade from pneumonia and other major diseases, a new analysis has found ahead of the first ever global forum on childhood pneumonia taking place this week.\n",
      "According to a new model from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, scaling up pneumonia treatment and prevention services can save the lives of 3.2 million children under-five.\n",
      "That would create a so-called ‘ripple effect’ that would prevent 5.7 million extra child deaths from other major childhood diseases at the same time.\n",
      "“If we are serious about saving the lives of children”, said UN Children’s Fund Executive Director, Henrietta Fore, “we have to get serious about fighting pneumonia.\n",
      "“As the current coronavirus outbreak shows, this means improving timely detection and prevention”, she added.\n",
      "Pneumonia is the biggest single killer of children worldwide, claiming the lives of 800,000 children last year, or 1 child every 39 seconds.\n",
      "‘Unprecedented threat’ from rising numbers of Desert Locusts\n",
      "The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) warned on Wednesday that rising numbers of Desert Locusts present an “extremely alarming and unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods” in the Horn of Africa.\n",

      "DR Congo can rise above ‘deadly cocktail’ of conflict, rights violations\n",
      "The UN human rights chief has ended a five-day mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with a call on both the country’s Government and the international community “to seize the opportunity that currently exists to lift the country out of its deadly cocktail of conflicts, human rights violations and chronic socio-economic problems.”\n",
      "Michelle Bachelet said there were grounds for optimism, given the first peaceful transfer of power since independence, which “makes positive change a possibility.”\n",
      "The DRC has been gripped by decades of war, involving dozens of armed groups, corruption and political instability, exacerbated by the worst Ebola outbreak in its history.\n",
      "High Commissioner Bachelet said that while it will take a “concerted and sustained effort over many years” to resolve entrenched problems, “some of the means towards solutions have been clearly identified, and there have been signs of progress in a few areas, most notably in the release of political prisoners and activists.”\n",

      "Tweet: 'No need for general public to change their behavior' Chicago Department of Health says By SEAN HAMMOND Follow Teresa Crawford Caption Dr. Allison Arwady, Commissioner, Chicago Department of Public Health, center, speaks at a news conference Thursday, Jan. 30, 2020, in Chicago, where it was announced that the first U.S. case of person-to-person spread of the new virus from China involves the man married to the Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, China. Joining Arwady from left are, Dr. Terry Mason, Cook County Department of Public Health Chief Operating Officer and Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health. (AP Photo/Teresa Crawford)\n",
      "CHICAGO – A second person has been diagnosed with the coronavirus in Chicago, health officials said Thursday, and it is the first U.S. case of the virus spreading person-to-person.\n",
      "The second patient is the husband of a woman who caught the disease after traveling to Wuhan, China.\n",
      "The latest case is the sixth in the U.S. The other five U.S. cases were travelers who developed the respiratory illness after returning to the U.S. from China. The latest patient had not been to China. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency on Thursday afternoon.\n",
      "The Chicago woman came back from the central China city of Wuhan on Jan. 13, then last week went to a hospital with symptoms and was diagnosed with the viral illness. She and her husband, both in their 60s, are hospitalized. Neither has been identified.\n",
      "The man was placed in isolation when he began showing symptoms Tuesday. Testing from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed he had contracted the virus on Wednesday night.\n",
      "Even with Thursday’s news, officials stressed that this is not a public health emergency at this time.\n",
      "Health officials are investigating 21 possible cases of the virus in Illinois.\n",
      "“The health to the general public from novel coronavirus remains low at this time,\" said Dr. Allison Arwady, the commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health. “Chicago and Illinois have been building our public health preparedness systems for years. We have a solid response plan in place. There is no need for the general public to change their behavior in any way based on today’s news.”\n",
      "Arwady said the second patient did not use public transportation and had not attended any large gatherings in recent weeks.\n",
      "Additionally, health officials don't believe patients are contagious until they begin to show symptoms.\n",
      "After the man’s wife was diagnosed with coronavirus, officials began monitoring the man closely, along with any other contacts who might have interacted with the woman. Arwady said officials are keeping a close eye on anyone who was in close contact with both patients.\n",
      "“We assess these contacts, continue to follow up with each contact every day to monitor for any new symptoms,” Arwady said. “We focus on limiting the spread of disease. We work in coordination with federal, state and many local public health partners to identify close contacts of any confirmed case, as well as the health care workers.”\n",
      "Experts have said they expected additional U.S. cases, and that at least some limited spread of the disease in the country was likely.\n",
      "“We anticipated this,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. “The kind of contact that you have in a household is very close and very prolonged. That’s the kind of circumstance where we would anticipate a virus such as this could be transmitted.\"\n",
      "The quick detection and isolation of the new patient shows, \"the system is working,” said Schaffner, adding that he does not expect the virus to become widespread in the country.\n",
      "The new virus is a member of the coronavirus family that's a close cousin to the SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past. The new virus has sickened thousands, mostly in China, and killed about 170. It is believed symptoms appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure.\n",
      "Older people, and those with other health conditions, are believed to be at greater risk for severe illness from the virus. The new patient has a health condition, but health officials did not say what it is.\n",
      "An international outbreak caused by the virus first emerged last month in China. Doctors there began seeing the new virus in people who got sick after spending time at a wholesale food market in Wuhan. Officials said the virus probably initially spread from animals to people, as did SARS and MERS.\n",
      "The other U.S. cases are in Arizona, Southern California, and Washington state.\n",

      "The president's comments contrast sharply with the fierce criticism he lobbed at his predecessor, President Barack Obama, during the 2014-15 Ebola crisis, which left more than 11,000 dead in three West African nations.\n",
      "At the time, Trump ripped into Obama as a “dope” and “incompetent\" and called for a travel ban on visitors from Ebola-infected countries. Trump also advocated preventing infected American health care workers from coming home for treatment.\n",
      "Obama faced some criticism from public health officials for being slow to address the Ebola crisis initially, but also received plaudits for eventually attacking it with vigour . He nudged Congress to make a $5.4 billion emergency appropriation to aid the fight and sent 3,000 U.S. troops to West Africa to help with the international response.\n",
      "Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said he’s taken a measure of comfort in the fact that Trump, so far, hasn't overreacted and has resisted “fanning the flames” as he did with his rhetoric during the Ebola crisis.

      "\"As long as that continues and as long as there isn’t political interference or mass quarantines in the U.S. or outright travel bans, I will feel comfortable with how the White House is handling it,” Gostin said.

      "By Dmitry Zhdannikov\n",
      "LONDON (Reuters) - After 169 years of keeping the business in the family, agricultural commodity giant Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) is open to selling a large non-controlling stake to an external stakeholder, its chairwoman told Reuters.\n",
      "Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who assumed control of the company in 2009, stressed she was in no rush and that an investor would have to strengthen the business.\n",
      "Last year, the billionaire businesswoman completed consolidating Louis Dreyfus Company Holdings B.V. (LDHBV) - the structure that holds the family's shares in LDC - via her Akira family trust which now controls over 96% of the holding firm.\n",
      "She has spent a decade negotiating costly and acrimonious buyouts of minority family shareholders, while profits at LDC declined in increasingly tough agricultural markets.\n",
      "\"It is the first time in our almost 170-year history that we are prepared to open our capital to an external shareholder,\" the 57-year-old said in an interview.\n",
      "\"But we are not under pressure. We want to keep majority control. Everything else depends on the quality of offers.\"\n",
      "The group has previously indicated it could bring \"regional players\" into the business to help strengthen its positions in areas where it seeks expansion, such as China.\n",
      "Akira's consolidation of LDC's ownership has come at a cost: it borrowed $1 billion from Credit Suisse last year to buy out the minority shareholders, pledging its shares in LDC as collateral, its filing showed.\n",
      "Credit Suisse declined to comment.\n",
      "This comes at a time when LDC, like its rivals, faces a challenging business environment - with swine fever in China, which could hit economic growth and protein demand in the world's largest consumer of pork, as well as the coronavirus outbreak.\n",
      "'NOW COMPANY IS FREE'\n",
      "LDC, also known as Dreyfus, is the \"D\" of the \"ABCD\" quartet of global agri-traders that also includes Archer Daniels Midland , Bunge and Cargill .\n",
      "Like its peers, LDC has restructured operations, exiting activities including dairy and metals trading while focusing more on food processing, notably in Asia.\n",
      "The company's top priority was to develop its business, said Louis-Dreyfus, a Russian-born Swiss citizen.\n",
      "\"Until 2018 we were in a process of consolidating the company's shareholder structure. Now the company is free of that issue and can fully focus on the business.\"\n",
      "A new investor should bring value to strengthen the company, she said.\n",
      "\"It is not only about size. It is also about quality.\"\n",
      "Speculation about consolidation has been rife in the industry since takeover approaches for U.S.-based Bunge.\n",
      "Commodity group Glencore made an approach for Bunge two years ago and has said the sector needs consolidating. China's COFCO International has also been seen as a potential bidder for other trading firms as it expands overseas.\n",
      "'ADAPTING TO NEW REALITY'\n",
      "In October 2019, Dreyfus reported a first-half net profit from continuing operations of $73 million, down from $91 million a year earlier, and said international trade tensions and the swine disease epidemic would weigh on its annual profit.\n",
      "Full-year 2019 results will be published later this year. Louis-Dreyfus said it would show a \"resilient\" bottom line despite a challenging backdrop of swine fever and trade tensions, which depressed U.S. soybean imports into China.\n",
      "\"We are adapting to a new reality of higher volatility and political unpredictability,\" Louis-Dreyfus said, adding that a recovery of crush margins -- the profits made from processing soybeans -- and cost savings should help 2020 results.\n",
      "A cost-cutting programme announced internally in November is being led by new Chief Operating Officer Michael Gelchie, whose appointment was part of a recent management reshuffle, the latest in a series of changes.\n",
      "\"We are cautiously optimistic that we shall see a rebound in 2020,\" she said.\n",
      "Over the past decade, Louis-Dreyfus has bought the shares of minority family members wishing to sell under a long-term arrangement established by her late husband, Robert. Akira increased its ownership in LDHBV to over 96% from 50.1%.\n",
      "\"In fact, all we have been doing these years is following Robert's guidance to develop the company's strategy,\" she said.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy grew at a moderate 2.1% rate in the final three months of 2019, capping a year when growth slowed significantly due to a weaker global economy and trade war uncertainties.\n",
      "The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the fourth-quarter increase in the gross domestic product, the economy’s total output of goods and services, matched the 2.1% gain of the third quarter. Both quarters were well below the 3.1% surge seen in the first quarter.\n",
      "For the October-December quarter, growth was supported by solid but slower consumer spending and an improvement in the trade deficit. Those factors offset a further drop in business investment in new plants and equipment and a slowdown in restocking store shelves.\n",
      "For the whole year, GDP increased 2.3%, the weakest performance in three years and a slowdown from a 2.9% gain in 2018 when the economy got a boost from President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and billions of dollars in increased government spending.\n",
      "Economists look for even slower growth in 2020 of around 1.8%. But that outcome could be threatened by various threats from a spreading coronavirus in China to a flare-up in trade tensions between the United States and China.\n",
      "Even the U.S. presidential election could end up having an adverse effect on growth if a hard-fought campaign increases uncertainty among consumers and businesses and causes them to cut back on spending.\n",
      "While Trump has not achieved his GDP growth goals, he has seen unemployment fall to a 50-year low during his presidency, and after trade tensions with China began to cool late last year, the stock market rebounded and climbed to new record highs.\n",
      "“I think the economy is President Trump’s friend, but it is not his best friend,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Unemployment is low, the stock market is high, wage growth is sturdy and gas prices are low.”\n",
      "But Zandi said what will matter most in the election is how the economy is performing in key swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin and there, Zandi said, the trade war has “done a lot of damage” by disrupting manufacturing.\n",
      "For the fourth quarter, consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of economic activity, slowed to an annual gain of 1.8%. While that was still a solid number, it was down from a spending surge of 4.6% in the second quarter and 3.2% in the third quarter. The slowdown was led by a drop-off in new car sales.\n",
      "Business investment spending fell for a third straight quarter, dropping at a rate of 1.5%, a decline that has been blamed on business uncertainty generated by the rising trade tensions. The hope is that business will start investing again now that the Trump administration has declared a ceasefire with China as both countries signed a Phase One trade deal earlier this month.\n",
      "Trade actually contributed to growth in the fourth quarter as imports, which subtract from U.S. growth, fell much faster than exports. The change added 1.5 percentage-points to growth in the fourth quarter. However, economists do not expect that positive impact to last as they look for America’s demand for imports to start growing again.\n",
      "Business stockpiling subtracted a full percentage-point to growth with part of that blamed on the General Motors strike which cut into car inventories.\n",

      "Tweet: Chinese airline stocks hammered as lockdown remains but rebound seen if travel ban eased By Umesh Desai , Hong Kong\n",
      "The rapidly spreading coronavirus and the travel restrictions aimed at curtailing it have crimped air travel, forcing analysts to lower airline income estimates. But the impact should be temporary as containment measures take hold.\n",
      "âA decline in cash flow is probably already hitting airlines with meaningful exposure to China and the wider Asia-Pacific region, and will continue until the virus is contained and normal travel volumes resume,â said S&P Global analysts in a report published on Thursday. âAny effect on air transport is usually temporary following containment.â\n",
      "The death toll from the coronavirus has climbed to 170 and the number of infected cases has risen to over 7,000 as isolations and travel clampdowns remain in place.\n",
      "The International Air Transport Association, the industry trade group said past episodes indicate that the coronavirus is unlikely to have a long-term effect on air travel demand.\n",
      "âIn the past, the airline industry has proven resilient to shocks, including pandemics. Even in the outbreak of SARS, monthly international passenger traffic returned to its pre-crisis level within nine months,â the report said. IATA is the trade association for the worldâs airlines, representing some 290 airlines or 82% of total air traffic.\n",
      "It estimated that passenger air traffic (revenue passenger kilometers) was about 35% lower at the SARS outbreak’s worst point for airlines in the Asia-Pacific region. For 2003 as a whole, IATA estimates SARS cost those airlines 8% of their revenues (about $6 billion at the time).\n",
      "But such comparisons may be flawed.\n",
      "âIt is hard to compare with SARS as airlines are completely different these days â more destinations, higher traffic. There is pressure on yields (ticket prices) and that has a big impact,â said Andrew Lee, Jefferies aviation analyst.\n",
      "Indeed, Credit Suisse said the passenger demand decline was off a base that was seven times smaller than todayâs volumes andÂ the IATA report said an additional 450 million passengers fly to from and within China per year compared with a decade ago.\n",
      "As expected, Chinese airlines have suffered the most.\n",
      "Share prices of the 3 Chinese airlines â China Southern, China Eastern and Air China â have fallen by 20-22% from this monthâs highs, lagging the 14% and 7% decline in regional rivals Cathay Pacific and SIA, which have smaller exposure to China and thus are less affected by the lockdown moves.\n",
      "âThe impact will be felt more by Chinese airlines than others because the dominant share of their business is on the mainland and in any case they were expanding too fast even before the coronavirus outbreak,â said Jefferiesâ Lee. “The Chinese new year holidays have been extended and therefore the lockdown will also continue. The catalyst for the next move will be a slowdown in the number of cases or lifting of travel restrictions.”\n",
      "But he said there is pent-up outbound demand given the travel restrictions. When that will play out depends on how long the lockdown continues.\n",
      "Chinaâs share of global traffic is much more elevated than before, so the impact would be greater this time around.\n",
      "âChina’s air travel market is larger and better connected to the rest of the world than ever before, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of global aviation (Chinese airlines carry 15% of global air traffic). Hence, larger ripple effects are likely if the coronavirus continues,â said S&P Global.\n",
      "For the moment the sector is likely to remain under pressure as confirmed cases are set to increase.\n",
      "âDuring SARS in 2003, share prices bottomed only 2 months after [the pathogen was] first recognized by WTO on 26 Feb 2003 despite China total pax [passenger] traffic declining until June 2003. We expect pax yields to be under pressure if traffic declines,â said Jefferies analysts in a note. \n",

      "Tweet: Tough quarantine measures have spread across China In Hubei province, a population the size of Italy’s is under lockdown W EIJI VILLAGE is a bleak spot in winter, even without the disease-control roadblock just up the road complete with medical staff in blue protective suits, using pistol-shaped electronic thermometers to check the foreheads of drivers and passengers for signs of fever. The village’s colour palette ranges from the grey of the sky to flat green fields of winter wheat and the brown of mud-filled potholes so deep that ordinary cars cannot pass. China is full of rural scenes like this one, in a forgotten corner of Henan province. Weiji’s only distinction is that it is a border village, a short walk from Hubei, an inland province of nearly 60m people (roughly the population of Italy) that has been all but sealed off from the outside world to slow the spread of a dangerous new coronavirus. Chinese cities brim with migrant workers from villages like Weiji, hauling bricks on building sites or delivering fast food on electric mopeds. During China’s rapid growth of the past 40 years, such people have helped spread wealth to the countryside. They send money back to home villages with taps on a smartphone app—for China is way ahead of the West when it comes to mobile payments—and return in person for the lunar new year, laden with gifts of city-bought clothes and fancy foods. Not this year, however. About 200 migrants from Weiji work in Hubei’s capital, Wuhan, the city where the virus was discovered (pictured, under lockdown). Because some returned to the village for the new year, which began on January 25th, Weiji was dragged into a vast quarantine operation that has trapped tens of millions of Chinese in their homes, grounded some international flights, halted long-distance bus services and closed the country’s largest tourist sites. The virus-control campaign explains a splash of colour on Weiji’s almost-empty main street, a red banner urging locals to be tested. It reads: “Find It Early! Treat It Early! Medical Fees All Free!” That encouraging, cajoling sign is buttressed by a dose of coercion. The village’s fresh-faced Communist Party chief, who wears a smart black windbreaker, describes instructions from higher-ups. Cars with Hubei number plates are to be turned away, and migrants returning from that province sent back. Those who made it home to Weiji before controls were imposed on January 20th must submit to temperature checks twice a day and remain indoors in their family homes, with no visitors allowed. Foreign experts may debate the medical efficacy of mass quarantines, but locals describe a sense of comfort from doing something to fight what President Xi Jinping calls a “devil” virus. A farmer and grandfather of two points to government notices fluttering on shuttered shop fronts. Officials have said that staying at home is “the biggest contribution one can make”, he explains. Unbidden, another local offers a patriotic commentary to the foreign reporter in his village. When the government tells the Chinese people to make sacrifices for the country, they listen, he booms. “It’s different from your Western countries.” Many villages have shut themselves off from outsiders using barricades made of freshly-dug earth, lumps of concrete or, in one case, a parked tractor (an example outside the village of Wangyoufang, southern Henan, is pictured). At one such roadblock, old men in disposable face-masks sit at a wooden office desk, a pot of thermometers in front of them. The campaign is an odd mix of high and low technology. Henan police questioning this reporter were able to summon up his photograph and details by tapping his Chinese telephone number into a mobile device. But electronic thermometers gave very different readings in the space of a few seconds—an alarming flaw when even a hint of fever at a checkpoint can result in 14 days of quarantine. Mao had it easy The virus’s spread is straining a public health system that lags other Chinese infrastructure (under-staffed, ill-equipped hospitals sit next to gleaming high-speed railway stations). It is also a giant test for an authoritarian, one-party political system designed in a simpler China, when most workers toiled for the state or rural collectives, rarely moved around and relied on state and party news outlets to learn what was going on. Today bullet trains criss-cross the country. Affluent urbanites use lunar new year to take foreign holidays. Even villagers in Weiji admit to reading criticisms of the government’s crisis response on such social-media platforms as Weibo or WeChat, though censors still race to delete any posts chiding Mr Xi and other national leaders. Posts rebuking lower-level authorities are being allowed more often than usual. When Hubei Daily , a party newspaper, warned readers to refrain from rumour-mongering, it triggered a sardonic backlash. “I can only trust the punctuation marks in Hubei Daily ,” grumbled a commentator on Weibo. Police have punished actual rumour-spreaders, such as a man detained in south-eastern China for three days for (falsely) messaging friends about an infected stranger roaming his village. In contrast, eight “rumour-mongers” punished by Wuhan police, in a case announced on January 1st and covered prominently by state media, were in fact doctors sharing early tidings of a strange new virus in a medical WeChat group. In a rare intervention, the Supreme People’s Court posted an online article on January 28th lamenting the silencing of those doctors. Schooled in the idea that they live in an all-knowing surveillance state, Chinese netizens have reacted with surprise as the virus campaign reveals the authorities’ blind spots. The websites of big state newspapers have published lists of more than 100 flights and trains taken by infected people, urging fellow-passengers to seek medical tests. How come the authorities cannot find passengers in a split second, asked a Weibo user, adding: “Aren’t we all 2020-big-data-high-tech now?” China’s response to the virus has been unmistakably authoritarian, involving the locking down of Hubei’s cities, and mandatory orders to stay indoors for a fortnight for those who leave Hubei and head to such centres as Shanghai. But it is not totalitarian. Unlike in the Mao era, when blind loyalty was demanded from citizens, the party has at times responded to public anger with a hint of understanding. In a much-discussed state television interview, Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, offered to resign if the public wished. Still, his mea culpa contained an unsubtle jab at his masters in Beijing. Acknowledging that the city had held back information about the outbreak, Mr Zhou noted that he needed superiors’ permission to disclose news of an infectious disease. The principle of quarantine is rarely challenged, even in Wuhan. Residents reached by telephone describe a mix of community spirit, such as bakeries offering free food to medics, a mass singing of the national anthem out of apartment windows as well as some grumbling about confusing and draconian local decisions. In a city of 9m people (the mayor says another 5m left, just before the quarantine was imposed, because of the holiday and the virus) taxis are now the only public transport. They can no longer be hailed on the streets, however, or summoned through an app. They have been commandeered by the city. Duties include “emergency runs” such as ferrying the sick to hospitals, says Wang Jie, a retired taxi driver. Rides are free. The city pays drivers 600 yuan ($86) a day, more than double what they make in normal times. Still, many fear being infected, says Ms Wang. Most have to buy their own protective masks, goggles and gloves. Ignore the welcome sign Hundreds of expatriates left Wuhan on chartered airliners this week. Philippe Klein, a French doctor serving the city’s expatriate community (Wuhan is home to big French car factories), is staying put. Dr Klein, whose clinic is attached to the Union Hospital, describes exhausted local doctors being relieved by military medics, and by volunteer doctors from other provinces. The number of new patients seeking testing had been growing each day but has now stabilised, he says. Hospital bosses hope that the epidemic will peak in Wuhan around February 8th. If disease prevention began slowly, one reason was the cost of being tested, which put some locals off. Now the state will pay. It has built field hospitals to house those who test positive. “Overall, I am optimistic,” says Dr Klein. Lu Xiaoyu, an academic who works in Australia but who flew back to Wuhan for the lunar new year, says morale is rising. Fine weather on January 28th brought residents out of their homes. Neighbourhood food shops have reopened, sparing people from stressful trips to large supermarkets. A lingering concern involves discrimination against Wuhan folk both inside and outside China. “We have turned into refugees,” he worries. Such concerns are well-founded. On January 27th several dozen people from Shanghai refused to board a plane in Japan when they realised that a small contingent from Wuhan was aboard. (Their accent gave them away.) The incident went viral on China’s social media. Many netizens backed the Shanghainese. The virus has given new energy to localist sentiment within the protest movement in Hong Kong, where anti-mainland prejudice lurks alongside a yearning for greater political freedom. Bowing to public pressure, Hong Kong’s government is denying entry to Hubei residents and those recently in the province. That did not stop someone posting online bomb threats and demands to seal the mainland border, shortly after police found three small, home-made explosive devices. Chinese leaders insist that one-party rule is vital for stability and progress. The world will judge, in due course, whether their brand of bossy, secretive authoritarianism helped to stop a pandemic, or let the coronavirus spread out of control. Already, the crisis is revealing a country which talks a lot about unity and is capable of great feats of national mobilisation, but which is easily divided and painfully low on trust. That is an ailment for which party bosses seem to have no cure. ■ This article appeared in the China section of the print edition under the headline \"Tough quarantine measures have spread across China\" \n",

      "But Apple ( AAPL ) , perhaps, stands to lose more than others: It relies heavily on manufacturing in China and on Chinese consumers as a key revenue driver. Although many analysts think it's too early to tell just how hard Apple might be hit by the disease, any major or extended disruption could hammer its production and sales in one blow. Apple had been looking forward to a turnaround in China. Last year, slumping demand hit sales numbers, and trade tensions caused uncertainty for its supply chain. But in the three months ending in December, sales in the region returned to growth, thanks in large part to the popularity of the iPhone 11. Now, fears about the spread of coronavirus may dash hopes of sustained improvement in the region — at least so long as the outbreak continues — putting a damper on an otherwise successful earnings report . \"The return to growth in China is very impressive,\" D.A. Davidson senior analyst Tom Forte said. \"Were it not for the coronavirus, the sustainability of (the performance in China) would not be called into question ... (It) is an important risk that investors need to monitor.\" Read More The company on Tuesday projected revenue between $63 billion and $67 billion for the current quarter, which ends in March, a wider-than-usual range due to the uncertainty caused by coronavirus. All things considered, that guidance is pretty strong, said Synovus Trust Company senior portfolio manager Dan Morgan. \"If Apple was overly concerned about it, they might have given us more of an indication in their guidance,\" Morgan said. However, the outbreak is evolving rapidly. More than 7,700 worldwide have now been infected with the coronavirus, and at least 170 people have died. Chinese officials had already extended the Lunar New Year holiday from January 30 to February 2, forcing companies to keep their doors closed longer in hopes of stemming the spread of the virus. Some retailers, including Starbucks and Pizza Hut, announced that they plan to suspend store operations even beyond the end of the holiday, and some airlines are offering refunds to people who cancel their travels. CEO Tim Cook said on a call with Wall Street analysts Tuesday that Apple has closed one retail store and shortened hours at some of the others that remain open. He added that the company is regularly deep cleaning stores that remain open, and is conducting temperature checks on employees to avoid the spread of the virus. How the coronavirus is already hurting global business \"We're also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week,\" Cook said. \"The situation is emerging and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely.\" Cook said that while the sales at the Wuhan area store are relatively small, store closures at other Apple retailers and a general decline in retail traffic across the country could negatively impact sales. Sales in China make up about 15% of Apple's total revenue. But unlike some other retailers, Apple has more to worry about than just its consumer sales. The company's manufacturing — particularly the production of the iPhone — is centered in China . Apple has some suppliers in Wuhan, which is known as a manufacturing hub, and Cook said Chinese officials have delayed the opening of factories in that area from the end of January to February 10. The company aimed to factor the risk of lost production at those facilities into its guidance for the current quarter, and has developed a mitigation plan based on alternate sources, Cook said Tuesday. However, he said the impact of the disease on production facilities in other areas of the country is \"less clear at this time.\" Foxconn, one of Apple's main manufacturing partners in the region, especially for the iPhone, said in a statement Wednesday that it is following \"holiday schedules,\" indicating it does not plan to keep factories closed beyond what is currently required by Chinese officials. \"As a matter of policy and for reasons of commercial sensitivity, we do not comment on our specific production practices but we can confirm that we have measures in place to ensure that we can continue to meet all global manufacturing obligations,\" the company said. It added that having previously handled the SARS out break in the early 2000s, the company understands how to mitigate the effects of such an outbreak. That's likely a good sign for Apple, at least for now, Synovus' Morgan said. \"With the SARS events a few years ago, everyone got all upset but it didn't really do too much,\" Morgan said. \"They have a whole chip and hardware ecosystem (in the region), so if you start to see that having problems, that will be an indication that Apple could have an issue. If they do, then, yeah, maybe there's some risk going into the second quarter for Apple.\"\n",

      "Tweet: Huge liner remains on lockdown though preliminary tests on two passengers suggest they are not carrying virus. More than 6,000 people were still on board a cruise ship in the Italian port city of Civitavecchia late on Thursday after the liner was placed on lockdown over fears two Chinese passengers could be carrying the coronavirus.\n",
      "Preliminary tests on the pair suggested they were not carrying the virus, the ministry of health said, although definitive results could take up to 48 hours.\n",
      "In the meantime, Ernesto Tedesco, the mayor of Civitavecchia, a city north of Rome, has asked that passengers on the Costa Smeralda, among them 66 Britons, be disembarked only when the results are definitive.\n",

      "The UN agency advises people to:\n",
      "Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers Avoid direct, unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals when visiting live markets in affected areas Avoid eating raw or undercooked animal products and exercise care when handling raw meat, milk or animal organs to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.\n",

      "Tedesco’s spokesperson said on Thursday night: “We don’t have the authority to stop the disembarkation but we ask that they wait for the response from the hospital. It’s a matter of precaution for everyone.”\n",

      "Tweet: WASHINGTON (AP) — Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross suggested Thursday that the viral outbreak in China might offer an unexpected benefit for the U.S. economy: It could encourage American manufacturers in China to return to the United States.\n",
      "“I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to U.S., probably some to Mexico as well,’’ Ross told Fox Business Network.\n",
      "The new virus, from the coronavirus family, has paralyzed business in China. The industrial hub of Wuhan and other Chinese cities are on lockdown. China has reported more than 7,700 cases and 170 deaths.\n",
      "The crisis has also begun to ripple through U.S. companies with operations in China. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the company's suppliers in China have been forced to delay reopening factories that closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. More than half of Starbucks’ stores in China are now closed. McDonald’s has closed several hundred restaurants in China.\n",
      "Ross emphasized that he didn’t “want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease.’’\n",
      "He added, though, that “the fact is, it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain.’’\n",
      "Even before the viral outbreak, many U.S. and other foreign companies had been rethinking their presence in China and considering their options for relocating elsewhere, possibly elsewhere in Asia. That is partly because President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese imports in a war over Beijing’s economic policies and partly because Chinese labor and other costs have been rising.\n",
      "But skeptics doubt that many American companies with deep roots in China might abandon the country purely over the virus. For one thing, no one knows how long the viral outbreak will last or how much damage it may inflict. And it takes significant time for companies to choose suppliers or locations for their factories.\n",
      "Rosemary Coates, whose Blue Silk Consulting firm helps companies make such decisions, said it was “ridiculous’’ to think the viral outbreak would result in a significant return of business to the United States.\n",
      "“You can’t snap your fingers,’’ she said. “It can take 18 months or two years to find another supplier. It isn’t easy. It’s complicated.’’\n",
      "Wuhan, a center of China’s steel industry, has attracted General Motors and many other foreign manufacturing giants.\n",
      "“You can’t just say General Motors is going to pick up and move away,’’ Coates said. “They have a manufacturing plant there and expertise there. Their supply chain runs through there.’’\n",
      "In fact, U.S. direct investment in China, which includes factories, continued to rise even after the SARS outbreak disrupted the Chinese economy in 2003. And labor costs will continue to remain far higher in the United States than in China and other Asian countries such as Vietnam.\n",
      "“Companies that are leaving China are not coming to the U.S.,’’ said Coates, who is also executive director of the Reshoring Institute, a nonprofit that researches issues surrounding corporate decisions on whether to return to the United States. “They’re going to other Asian countries ... IIf low cost is the only goal, then the U.S. is not the answer.''\n",
      "Asked about Ross’ comments, Larry Kudlow, President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, declined to endorse the notion that the U.S. economy stands to benefit from China’s health crisis.\n",
      "“This is not about trade, jobs or any of that,’’ Kudlow told reporters. He added: \"The president has a lot of compassion for the Chinese situation. The threat of large numbers of people dying is a terrible thing. We just want to help.’’\n",

      "Tweet: Genetic analysis of coronavirus published in The Lancet By - January 30, 2020\n",
      "A new genetic analysis of coronavirus has been published in The Lancet. The analysis of 10 genome sequences of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from nine patients in Wuhan finds that the virus is most closely related to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses.\n",
      "The authors say that although their analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of the virus, an animal sold at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host that enables the emergence of the virus in humans. For this reason, the future evolution, adaptation and spread of this virus requires urgent investigation.\n",
      "In the study, the authors report the epidemiological data of nine patients who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause. Cell and secretion samples were taken from the patients’ lungs to harvest samples of the 2019-nCoV virus, which were analysed to determine the origin of the virus and how it enters human cells.\n",
      "Eight of the patients had visited the Huanan seafood market. One patient had never visited the market, but had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness.\n",
      "The authors found 2019-nCoV in all 10 genetic samples taken from the patients – including eight complete genomes, and two partial genomes. The genetic sequences of the samples were nearly identical (shared more than 99.98% of the same genetic sequence) – which indicates a very recent emergence of the virus into humans.\n",
      "“It is striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV described here from different patients were almost identical. This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very short period and was detected relatively rapidly. However, as the virus transmits to more individuals, constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed,” says one of lead authors Professor Weifeng Shi, Key Laboratory of Etiology and Epidemiology of Emerging Infectious Diseases in Universities of Shandong, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, China.\n",
      "Comparing the 2019-nCoV genetic sequence with a library of viruses, the authors found that the most closely related viruses were two SARS-like coronaviruses of bat origin – bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 – which shared 88% of the genetic sequence. 2019-nCoV was more genetically distant to the human SARS virus (which shared about 79% of the genetic sequence) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus (which shared about 50% of the genetic sequence).\n",
      "Studying the spike protein of the virus (how it binds then enters human cells), the authors found that 2019-nCoV and human SARS virus have similar structures, despite some small differences. As a result, the authors suggest that 2019-nCoV might use the same molecular doorway to enter the cells as SARS (a receptor called ACE2), but note that this will require confirmation.\n",
      "Based on their data, the authors say that it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats and transmitted to humans via a currently unknown wild animal sold at the Huanan seafood market.\n",
      "They say that it is more likely that bat coronaviruses are mutating, than 2019-nCoV – meaning that 2019-nCoV is unlikely to have emerged due to a chance mutation. However, more information is needed, and if a more closely related animal virus is identified, this suggestion could be wrong.\n",
      "This adds to the coronavirus clinical data previously published in The Lancet.\n",
      "“These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and 2019-nCoV in particular. However, despite the importance of bats, it seems likely that another animal host is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans,” says Professor Guizhen Wu, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "Explaining this she notes: “First, the outbreak was first reported in late December 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas many non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were. Third, the similarities in the genetic sequences between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 were less than 90%, meaning these two bat-derived coronaviruses are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV. Fourth, in both SARS and MERS, bats acted as the natural reservoir, with another animal acting as an intermediate host, and with humans as terminal hosts.This again highlights the hidden virus reservoir in wild animals and their potential to spill over into human populations.” TAGS\n",

      "Health officials Thursday reported the first U.S. case of person-to-person spread of the new virus from China.\n",
      "The man is married to the Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. There have been cases reported of the infectious virus spreading to others in a household or workplace in China and elsewhere.\n",
      "The new case is the sixth reported in the United States. The other five were travellers who developed the illness after returning to the U.S. from China. The latest patient had not been in China.\n",
      "The Chicago woman returned from central China on Jan. 13, then last week went to a hospital with symptoms and was diagnosed with the viral illness. She and her husband, both in their 60s, are hospitalized.\n",
      "Experts have said they expected additional cases, and that at least some limited spread of the disease in the United States was likely. Health officials think the new virus spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads.\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Illinois health officials said that health workers and people who have been in contact with the latest patient are being monitored for symptoms.\n",

      "Leaders in Toronto’s Chinese community said Wednesday the racist attitudes that led to widespread discrimination against Chinese Canadians during the SARS epidemic are threatening to resurface during the current outbreak of a new coronavirus.\n",
      "Community organizers held a news conference alongside local politicians, urging Torontonians — and Canadians at large — to learn from the mistakes of 2003, and inform themselves about this coronavirus rather than respond out of fear and implicit bias.\n",
      "Avvy Go, director of the Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic, said her agency fielded numerous complaints of human rights violations directly triggered by SARS-related hysteria.\n",
      "“I certainly hope … that we do not have a repeat of SARS — not just the virus, but the virus of racism,” Go said at the news conference. “And the only way to stop it is for … our civic leaders to speak out.”\n",
      "Go recalled helping tenants turned out by fearful landlords, workers who saw their hours scaled back by misinformed employers, and even Chinese refugee claimants taken aback when lawyers refused to be in the same room to hear their cases.\n",
      "Evidence suggests little has changed, community leaders said, citing a petition that calls for schools at a board north of Toronto to urge students who have recently returned from mainland China to “self-quarantine” for at least 17 days. The petition had garnered more than 9,800 signatures as of Wednesday afternoon.\n",
      "Toronto Mayor John Tory said he has heard of multiple instances of discrimination against Chinese residents as well as calls to boycott Chinese businesses. He decried all such incidents as unacceptable.\n",
      "“That kind of stigmatization is wrong,” Tory said. “It is ill-founded, and in fact could lead to a situation where we are less safe because it spreads misinformation at a time when people are in more need than ever of real information and real facts.”\n",
      "Amy Go, interim president of the Chinese Canadian National Council, said misinformation about the new virus is linked to implicit racism toward the Chinese community.\n",

The increased demand follows the recent outbreak of the deadly coronavirus originating from Wuhan, China. NatShield Letter from Malaysian MOH\n",
      "Holista confirmed that since mid-January 2020 it had sold out all NatShield(TM) Sanitizer in its inventory. Each bottle of NatShield(TM) Sanitizer contains 5% of Path-Away(R) which is made from natural plant-based substances that have been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug of Authority and tested by World Health Organization (“WHO”) approved laboratories in numerous countries around the world.\n",
      "Developed by Global Infection Control Consultants LLC (“GICC LLC”) based in South Carolina, USA, Path-Away(R) ( www.path-away.com ) is distributed in Malaysia by Holista as NatShield(TM) Sanitizer. Holista is the exclusive distributor of Path-Away(R) for the ASEAN region. ASEAN countries with confirmed cases of the coronavirus include Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Cambodia.\n",
      "Based on requests from seven chains representing over 3,000 pharmacies in Malaysia, Holista has ordered 60,000 bottles of NatShield(TM) Sanitizer to be air-freighted to Malaysia from the U.S.A. by mid-February.\n",
      "The novel coronavirus was first reported to WHO on 31 December 2019 and has been under investigation ever since. Countries with confirmed infections include the U.S.A., Canada, France, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Nepal.\n",
      "The active substance in the spray weakens the cell walls of the virus, causing the infectious organisms to clump together, in the process killing themselves, almost instantly.

      "WASHINGTON (AP) \" Just as the outlook for the global economy had been brightening in recent months, a new threat has suddenly emerged in the form of the viral outbreak in China.\n",
      "That was the cautionary message that Chairman Jerome Powell delivered Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates low after its latest policy meeting.\n",
      "Speaking at a news conference, Powell said the signing of a preliminary U.S.-China trade deal earlier this month, the resolution of Brexit and continuing low interest rates in the United States and abroad had suggested that the world economy would start to expand more quickly after being held back by trade conflicts. That scenario is now complicated by the emergence of the virus.\n",
      "Still, Powell noted that the extent of the economic damage that the virus may ultimately inflict, in China or around the world, remains unknown.\n",
      "'There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and globally,' Powell said. 'It's very uncertain how far it will spread and what the (economic) effects will be in China, for its trading partners, and around the world.... We are very carefully monitoring the situation.'\n",
      "Even so, Powell said he thinks there are 'there are signs and reasons to expect' a global economic rebound. And he said the initial U.S.-China trade agreement and a new trade pact among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday could potentially boost the U.S. economy.\n",
      "Powell spoke after the Fed had announced that it has kept its key interest rate unchanged in a low range of 1.5% to 1.75%, far below levels that were typical during previous expansions. The chairman and other Fed officials have indicated that they see that range as low enough to support faster growth and hiring.\n",
      "Investors, however, are increasingly betting that the Fed will feel compelled to cut rates later this year, likely out of concern that the U.S. will feel the impact of a global slowdown stemming from the coronavirus. The chances of a cut by September's Fed meeting have risen above 70%, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool, up from roughly 40% just a month ago.\n",
      "Still, Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said he saw nothing in the Fed's statement or at Powell's news conference to make him change his belief that the central bank will keep its benchmark rate unchanged for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "'Unless the U.S. experiences its own epidemic, we doubt that the indirect effects from the disruptions in China would be enough to warrant a U.S. rate cut,' Ashworth said.\n",
      "The coronavirus has in effect shut down much of that nation and seems sure to slow the Chinese economy \" the world's second-largest \" which had already been decelerating. The virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.\n",
      "Major companies across the world have responded to the virus by suspending some operations in China. Starbucks said it plans to close half its stores in China, its second-largest market. British Airways has halted all flights to China, and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing.\n",
      "Hotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the industries that have suffered the most immediate repercussions. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's suppliers in China have been forced to delay the re-opening of factories that have closed for the Chinese New Year holiday until Feb. 10.\n",
      "Stock prices slipped after the Fed issued its statement and Powell concluded his news conference. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed barely higher after having posted stronger gains in earlier trading. Bond yields declined slightly.\n",
      "The Fed's statement, which its policymaking committee approved 10-0, was nearly identical to the one it issued in December, though this time it described consumer spending as rising at only a 'moderate' rather than at a 'strong' pace. That change likely reflects relatively modest spending by Americans over the holiday shopping season.\n",
      "The statement also signaled that the Fed wants inflation to move higher. The Fed's preferred measure showed inflation rose just 1.5% in November from a year earlier, below its 2% target.\n",
      "'We're not comfortable with inflation running persistently below' the Fed's objective, Powell said. The Fed seeks inflation at that level as a cushion against deflation, a destabilizing drop in prices and wages.\n",
      "Last year, the Fed cut its benchmark rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018. Powell and other Fed officials credit those rate cuts with revitalizing the housing market, which had stumbled early last year, and offsetting some of the drag from President Donald Trump's trade war with China.\n",
      "On another topic, Powell said the Fed will continue its purchases of six-month Treasury bills to ensure that short-term lending markets operate smoothly. The Fed began buying $60 billion of the bills each month in October to expand cash reserves that are available for overnight lending, after a shortage of reserves caused overnight rates to spike. The lending squeeze also pushed the Fed's benchmark rate out of its target range.\n",
      "The Fed plans to continue its purchases until the second quarter, Powell said, while it slowly draws down some temporary lending it has also done to boost short-term lending markets.\n",
      "Powell said the overall economy, not just Wall Street, has benefited from the Fed's bond-buying because it's enabled the Fed's low-rate policy to reduce mortgage rates and other consumer borrowing costs.\n",
      "'That really is important for the public,' Powell said.\n",
      "The Fed's decision came a day after Trump, in a tweet, again pressed Powell to cut rates, arguing that this would make U.S. interest rates 'competitive with other Countries.' Yet the Fed hopes to avoid the ultra-low and negative interest rates that exist in much of Europe and in Japan, which they \" and most analysts \" see as evidence of weak economies.\n",

      "All three of the Canadian cases are linked to recent travel in China.\n",
      "Tam, who updated members of the House of Commons health committee on the outbreak, said the risk of catching the virus in Canada remains low.\n",
      "And she said Canada and the world are much better prepared to deal with a potential pandemic than they were during the outbreak of SARS, another coronavirus that killed more than 700 people worldwide from 2002-04.\n",
      "Among other things, she said international health regulations have been strengthened and Canada now has a public health agency that didn’t exist during the SARS outbreak, as well as improved laboratory and diagnostic capacity and better co-ordination among federal, provincial and territorial health authorities.\n",
      "The speed with which the three cases in Canada have been identified, diagnosed and managed “is a testament to how the system has improved over time,” Tam told the committee.\n",
      "That system will be tested as the virus spreads.\n",
      "For now, the only treatment available for those who catch the virus is “supportive care,” Tam said. But she said countries around the world are collaborating to see if any existing anti-viral remedies are useful in this case.\n",
      "A number of vaccines have previously been developed for other coronaviruses and she said countries around the globe are pulling together to see if they can accelerate development of a new vaccine that would protect against this particular strain.\n",
      "“But what I can say is that even with the most rapid acceleration, I don’t believe we are going to see a vaccine that is ready probably for a year,” Tam said. “So at least we have to plan for the fact that we’re going to be managing this particular virus with no specific vaccine.”\n",
      "Tina Namiesniowski, president of the Public Health Agency of Canada, told the committee it is to be expected that there will be travel-related cases in Canada and that the number of confirmed cases will rise.\n",
      "At the three airports that receive direct fights from China — Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal — information screens in the customs areas have been set up, advising people to self-report to customs officials if they are experiencing any symptoms of the novel coronavirus. At electronic kiosks, a question has been added, requiring travellers to specify if they’ve been in the Chinese province at the heart of the outbreak.\n",
      "By the end of the week, Namiesniowski said more public health officials will be in customs areas at the three airports to help border officials.\n",

      "Swatch Group AG fell to the lowest in a decade as Switzerland’s largest watchmaker faces a triple whammy from protests in Hong Kong, competition with smartwatches and the viral outbreak in China.\n",
      "Operating profit fell for the first time in three years, dropping 11% to 1.02 billion francs ($1.1 billion). Analysts expected 1.09 billion francs. The shares fell as much as 4.1% Thursday morning. Swatch aims to boost sales 5% to 6% this year at constant currency, Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in a phone interview.\n",
      "Swatch is feeling the pinch of weaker demand for lower-priced timepieces amid competition from the Apple Watch and fitness bands. Last year, Switzerland exported fewer watches in any year since 1984 as demand collapsed in the lower end of the market. Swatch depends on high-volume sales from brands like Tissot to have the scale necessary to keep its costs in check.\n",
      "“We expect growth in China this year, and won’t change now our forecasts because of the coronavirus,” Hayek said. “If it only lasts one to two months, it won’t have a negative impact for the year. Of course January and February will probably not show good numbers, but I’m confident the problem will be brought under control.”\n",
      "Luxury-goods makers are bracing for the impact of the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed 170 people since originating in Wuhan, China. The outbreak could reduce the industry’s earnings by as much as 8% this year, RBC analyst Piral Dadhania has estimated.\n",
      "The weaker results also show how much the Swiss watch industry relies on key market Hong Kong, where margins are typically higher due to lower taxes. Disruption in that market cut 200 million francs off of second-half sales, the company said. Chinese shoppers last year increasingly bought watches on the mainland to steer clear from political protests in Hong Kong.\n",
      "The owner of the Omega and Longines brands forecast “healthy” growth this year in local currencies in all markets except Hong Kong, where Hayek said he expects a strong double-digit decline.\n",

      "The January PMI reading was slightly down from 50.2 in December, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n",
      "The decline partly resulted from a slowdown in production growth due to the Lunar New Year holiday that reduced industrial activities, as the sub-index for production, though remaining in the expansion zone, lost 1.9 points to 51.3 in January month on month.\n",
      "Also because of the holiday break, up to 17.6 percent of the surveyed enterprises have complained about insufficient labor supply, 2.1 percentage points higher than a month ago, said NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe.\n",

      "In January, the PMI for high-tech manufacturing, equipment manufacturing and consumer goods all stayed above 50, showing accelerated industrial transformation and upgrades, according to Zhao.\n",
      "Friday's data also showed China's January composite PMI dropped marginally to 53 from 53.4 in December, indicating slower expansion in the overall production of China's companies.\n",
      "The PMI for China's non-manufacturing sector rose to 54.1 in January from 53.5 in December, NBS data showed. The sub-index for business activities in the service sector reached 53.1 this month, higher than the reading of 53 in December.\n",
      "The sub-reading for the non-manufacturing sector's business expectations also climbed to 59.6 in January as enterprises in the sector were increasingly optimistic about market prospects.\n",
      "But Zhao noted that it would require further observations to tell future developments as the PMI surveys were carried out before Jan. 20 when the impact of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak on production activities had yet to unfold.\n",
      "By the end of Thursday, 9,692 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, according to Chinese health authorities.\n",

      "China's GDP grew 6.1 percent year on year to 99.09 trillion yuan (14.28 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2019, within the government's annual target of 6 to 6.5 percent. The service sector accounted for more than half of the total economy, according to official data released earlier this month.\n",

      "By Alejandro Werner WASHINGTON DC, Jan 30 2020 (IPS)\n",
      "Economic activity in Latin America and the Caribbean stagnated in 2019, continuing with the weak growth momentum of the previous five years and adding more urgency and new challenges to reignite growth.\n",
      "Indeed, real GDP per capita in the region has declined by 0.6 percent per year on average during 2014–2019—a sharp contrast from the commodity boom’s average increase of two percent per year during 2000–2013.\n",
      "This weak momentum reflects structural and cyclical factors. On the structural side, potential growth remains constrained by low investment, slow productivity growth, a weak business climate, and the low quality of infrastructure and education.\n",
      "On the cyclical side, growth has been held back by low global growth and commodity prices, elevated economic policy uncertainty, economic rebalancing in some economies, and social unrest in others.\n",
      "Elevated policy uncertainty in several large Latin American countries continues to weigh on growth. For example, uncertainty about the course of economic policy and reforms in Brazil and Mexico likely contributed to the slowdown in real GDP and investment growth in 2019.\n",
      "Continued economic rebalancing in stressed economies that experienced sudden stops in capital flows in 2018-19 (Argentina, Ecuador), while helping restore internal and external balances, have also acted as a drag on economic growth.\n",
      "More recently, a few countries in the region experienced social unrest—Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, and Ecuador—which, in some cases, disrupted economic activity. Economic policy uncertainty has also risen in these countries as governments consider alternative policies and reforms to make growth more inclusive and address social demands.\n",
      "As noted in the recent World Economic Outlook update , growth in the region is projected to rebound to 1.6 percent in 2020 and 2.3 percent in 2021—supported by a gradual pick up in global growth and commodity prices, continued monetary support, reduced economic policy uncertainty, and a gradual recovery in stressed economies.\n",
      "However, there are also prominent downside risks. While previous external downside risks have moderated following globally synchronized monetary policy easing and the signing of the U.S.-China phase one trade deal, some new risks have appeared, including the potential global spread of the coronavirus, which could significantly disrupt global economic activity, trade, and travel.\n",
      "Domestic and regional downside risks have also intensified. Social unrest could spike throughout the region, while economic policy uncertainty could rise further due to both heightened social tensions and policy slippages.\n",
      "Economic policies will need to strike a balance between rebuilding policy space and maintaining economic stability on the one hand and supporting economic activity and strengthening the social safety net on the other hand.\n",
      "Although the causes and triggers of social unrest have varied across countries, they generally reflect discontent with some aspects of the economic and political systems. A key priority going forward is to reignite growth, while making it more inclusive.\n",
      "Promoting competition will be important to avoid monopolistic practices that may hurt the poor disproportionally. Tackling corruption and weak governance will help make political systems more representative, although deeper political reforms may be needed.\n",
      "Fiscal policy will need to support to growth, expand the social safety net, and improve the quality of public goods and services. However, in many countries, spending room in the budget remains constrained by high deficits and public debt.\n",
      "These countries will need to improve spending efficiency, reallocate spending from nonpriority areas to public investment and social transfers and increase revenues over the medium term to finance additional increases in these areas.\n",
      "Monetary policy can remain accommodative to support growth given the stable inflation outlook, well-anchored inflation expectations, and declining neutral rates worldwide.\n",
      "South America\n",
      "In Brazil , growth remained subdued at 1.2 percent in 2019, but is projected to accelerate to 2.2 percent in 2020 due to improving confidence following the approval of the pension reform and lower monetary policy interest rates in the context of low inflation.\n",
      "Steady implementation of the government’s broad fiscal and structural reform agenda will be essential to safeguard public debt sustainability and boost potential growth.\n",
      "In Chile , the outlook is subject to uncertainty resulting from social unrest and the evolving policy responses to the social demands. Following a sharp decline in late 2019, economic activity is expected to recover gradually supported by a significant fiscal expansion and looser monetary policy, with growth reaching about 1 percent in 2020.\n",
      "In Colombia , strong domestic demand led to a pickup in growth to 3.3 percent in 2019 and a widening of the current account deficit to 4½ percent of GDP. Growth is projected to accelerate to around 3½ percent in 2020 due to continued monetary support, migration from Venezuela, remittances, civil works and higher investment due to recent tax policy changes.\n",
      "In Peru , growth is estimated to have slowed to 2.4 percent in 2019, hampered by lower global trade and under-execution of government spending. With these factors dissipating in the coming years, growth is projected to recover to 3.2 percent in 2020 and 3.7 percent in 2021, with inflation remaining well-anchored within the central bank’s target range.\n",
      "Venezuela remains immersed in a deep economic and humanitarian crisis . Since the end of 2013, real GDP has contracted by 65 percent driven by declining oil production, hyperinflation, collapsing public services, and plummeting purchasing power.\n",
      "A continuation of these trends is projected for 2020, although at a slower pace. The acute humanitarian crisis has led to one of the largest migratory crises in history, with migration to neighboring countries expected to surpass 6 million—20 percent of the population—by 2020.\n",
      "Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean\n",
      "In Mexico , economic activity stagnated in 2019 due to policy uncertainty and slower global and U.S. manufacturing production. Growth is expected to recover to 1 percent in 2020 as conditions normalize, including with the ratification of the trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada (USMCA) and the recent easing of monetary policy, which should continue as along as inflation expectations are well-anchored.\n",
      "Fiscal policy should be geared at putting the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory, with priority on increasing revenues, improving the efficiency of spending, and enhancing the fiscal framework.\n",
      "In Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic growth is projected to rebound to 3.9 percent in 2020, from 3.2 percent in 2019, supported by the beginning of operations of a large copper mine in Panama , and accommodative monetary policy in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic . In Costa Rica , continued implementation of all measures in the fiscal reform bill will be key to rebuild market confidence and fiscal space.\n",
      "economic plan includes important efforts to improve institutional, governance, and anti-corruption frameworks supporting business confidence, while Guatemala is expected to continue benefitting from a fiscal impulse and economic reform plans of the new administration.\n",
      "El Salvador is already reaping the effects of the pro-growth agenda of the new administration inaugurated in June, while unfavorable political tensions in Nicaragua are creating a significant headwind to economic recovery.\n",
      "In the Caribbean , economic prospects are improving, but with substantial variation across countries. Growth in tourism-dependent economies is expected to strengthen in 2020. With commodity prices remaining broadly stable, commodity exporters are expected to see modest recovery in growth, while large oil discoveries and the start of their production in 2020 is expected to boost growth in Guyana .\n",
      "The region’s exposure to climate risks continues to require strong policies. Potential growth continues to be impeded by lingering structural problems including high public debt, weaker financial systems, high unemployment, and vulnerability to commodity and climate-related shocks.\n",
      "Some countries have started to strengthen their fiscal positions, but further tightening is needed in others to ensure debt sustainability.\n",

The virus has spread to at least 22 countries, and more than 200 people in China have died.\n",
      "Americans who are already in China \"should consider departing using commercial means,\" the State Department said Thursday night. The advisory for China now stands at \"Level 4: Do Not Travel\" — the same category the U.S. uses for hotspots such as Yemen, Libya and South Sudan.\n",
      "A number of other countries have issued similar travel warnings to their citizens, though many are focusing on Wuhan's Hubei province, where most of the cases have occurred, rather than the entire Chinese mainland.\n",
      "Singapore, for example, announced Friday that all foreign nationals who traveled to China within the past 14 days \"will not be allowed entry\" or transit through the island nation, which has 16 confirmed cases of the new strain of coronavirus.\n",
      "Singapore's government also says anyone holding a Chinese passport won't be given a visa to enter the country unless they can prove they haven't recently been to China.\n",
      "\"It is going to hurt us,\" Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Friday . He added that some 3 million Chinese tourists visit Singapore in a normal year.\n",
      "The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide has risen to nearly 10,000 — surpassing the 8,099 reported cases of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) during a 2003 outbreak.\n",
      "In Hong Kong, researchers who study respiratory illnesses say the coronavirus outbreak is only getting started.\n",
      "Those scientists are saying \"this outbreak is just in its early stages, and they expect it to get a lot worse before it gets better,\" NPR's Jason Beaubien reports. \"Chinese officials seem to also feel that way. They're actually building two brand-new hospitals right now in Wuhan to treat patients from this outbreak. So clearly they think this is going on for a while.\"\n",
      "The outbreak of SARS killed at least 744 people — more than three times the current death toll for the coronavirus — and spread to 32 countries after it was identified in China's Guangdong province. The hardest-hit areas other than the Chinese mainland were Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada.\n",
      "In Singapore, Lee says that while the new coronavirus seems to be more infectious than SARS, it has also been less lethal.\n",
      "\"The death rate is much lower, and in China, they are reporting that maybe about 20 per cent of the cases they see become seriously ill,\" he said, adding that there is no need to panic.\n",
      "The U.S. warning came hours after the WHO declared the outbreak to be a global health emergency Thursday, putting the coronavirus strain — identified as 2019-nCoV – in the same category as the H1N1 flu, zika, polio and Ebola.\n",

      "Tweet: (CNN) — The outbreak and spread of the coronavirus is causing widespread disruption, with airlines worldwide suspending all flights to China. At least 213 people have died from the virus, which originated in Wuhan, and the US State Department has advised against all travel to China, escalating its warnings to the highest level. The situation has left travelers with questions over whether they can expect insurance compensation for canceled trips. Travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip has reported a substantial increase in calls from worried passengers looking for clarification on their travel coverage. Although many airlines have relaxed their policies, offering waivers on amendment fees or the choice to cancel for credit towards an upcoming flight, it seems most travel insurance policies simply do not account for scenarios such as this. \"While many travel insurance plans provide for cancellation for an airline shut-down in services due to a mechanical failure, adverse weather or natural disaster, they do not provide for an airline shut-down due to the coronavirus outbreak,\" explains Stan Sandberg, co-founder of TravelInsurance.com . Related content Everything travelers need to know about Wuhan coronavirus Can I claim compensation? According to Sandberg, although some plans will provide for cancellation due to a traveler quarantine, this only applies to plans purchased before the outbreak became a \"known event,\" which was around January 21. However, there may be some level of trip cancellation protection available to those who happen to have purchased a Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR) optional upgrade. \"For those holding an existing travel insurance policy, they should contact their travel insurance providers to find out if their plans have any coverage,\" he adds. British Airways, American Airlines, United Airlines, Air Asia, Air India, Cathay Pacific, IndiGo and Lufthansa are among the airlines who've opted to cancel flights as authorities desperately attempt to contain the virus, which causes respiratory illness. Hotel chains such as IHG, Marriott and Accor have pledged to waive cancellation fees for booking at hotels in and around China until February 8. Cruise passengers have also been affected, with cruise lines, including MSC, Costa and Royal Caribbean reportedly canceling planned sailings to China, as well as boosting screening measures for passengers boarding from Chinese ports. Any travelers with impending plans to fly to China are advised to check with their airlines and look out for advisories published on the carriers' websites.

      "Tweet: ‘The infected are coming!’ Evacuees aboard Wuhan airlift document their return as plane carrying 83 Brits from coronavirus-hit Chinese city arrives at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire after 12-hour flight By Sam Blanchard Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline Published: 13:33 GMT, 31 January 2020 | Updated: 13:40 GMT, 31 January 2020 A jumbo jet carrying more than 100 passengers to the UK from the crisis-hit Chinese city of Wuhan has landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Some 83 British citizens trapped in the locked-down city at the centre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak have been flown to the UK to safety. They were met by a fleet of at least seven hired coaches which will ferry them to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, Merseyside, where they will be isolated for two weeks. The plane departed Wuhan at 9.45am local time today (1.45am UK time) and its passengers have endured a 12-hour flight under supervision of Army medics. All had to have health checks before being allowed on the plane and will be constantly monitored for the next two weeks. The UK first declared its first cases of the coronavirus earlier today and the country is now on high alert for more possible infections. The plane has touched down at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire carrying more than 100 people from the Chinese city of Wuhan One of the passengers onboard the flight posted on Instagram as the plane was coming into land. They then followed up the post with the caption: ‘The infected are coming’ Police in hazmat suits are pictured on the runway at Brize Norton today Police and paramedics are on standby near the plane, which will be carrying more than 100 people who could be infected with the coronavirus After landing, passengers will then be put onto buses which will take them on a three -and-a-half hour drive to accommodation at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, Merseyside, where they’ll be kept for two weeks. The group will be housed in a seven-storey NHS staff block with a pool table, TVs and Wi-Fi, including access to outdoor areas. Anyone with suspicious symptoms will be taken to the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospital. Passengers were asked to sign contracts agreeing to be quarantined as a condition of getting the flight. They will be allowed to work during the quarantine but cannot see visitors. Food and drink will be ordered in. Two weeks is the maximum incubation period of the illness – the duration between someone becoming infected and showing symptoms. The evacuation plane – chartered by Wamos Airline – carrying 83 Brits is pictured as it gets into RAF Brize Norton this afternoon The plane was Boeing 747-400, which can hold up to 475 passengers. Only 110 evacuees were confirmed to be on the flight from Wuhan :\n",

      "In the wake of mounting global concern about the coronavirus that has caused the deaths of over 100 people, the Marshall Islands issued a travel advisory January 24 banning travelers coming directly from the People’s Republic of China, where the virus originated.\n",
      "“Any traveler with travel originating from or transiting through the PRC must spend at least 14 days in a country not affected by 2019-nCoV (the World Health Organization’s designation for the new coronavirus),” said the travel restriction issued Friday by Marshall Islands Health Secretary Jack Niedenthal. “In the event a traveler arrives in the Marshall Islands within the 14 day period, entry will be denied.”\n",

      "People sickened by the virus that originated in Wuhan, China have been identified in many countries. Hundreds have been hospitalized in China, which has taken unprecedented action to shut down travel from Wuhan and other cities in an effort to halt the spread of the virus.\n",
      "“It is strongly recommended that all persons intending to travel to PRC or other affected countries postpone their travel arrangements,” said the new travel advisory issued by the Marshall Islands.\n",
      "“This is a rapidly evolving situation, with new developments daily,” said Niedenthal. Despite screening the US and other countries have started at airports, “no one has a way of foolproof screening for the coronavirus,” he said.\n",

      "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Thursday posted holiday quarter results well above expectations as the expansion of its one-day shipping program came under budget and membership in its Prime loyalty club notched a 50% rise in two years.\n",
      "Shares soared as much as 13% in after-hours trade, putting the online retailer back in the $1 trillion market capitalization club. If the share gain holds on Friday, it will be the biggest daily jump for Amazon since October 2017.\n",
      "Amazon also forecast operating income of up to $4.2 billion in the current quarter, down from $4.4 billion the year prior. Still, that appeared to assuage investor concerns about Amazon's continued spending on fast delivery, which could have erased windfalls from e-commerce, advertising and cloud computing sales.\n",
      "\"We’re past the worst in terms of the margin pressure from the one-day shipping initiative,\" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. That and the \"massively overstated\" concerns about cloud competition rebutted some of the biggest arguments against buying the stock, he said.\n",
      "Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters that additional investment in one-day shipping came slightly under the $1.5 billion the company had forecast for the fourth quarter, despite more customer orders. Extra costs in the current period will be about $1 billion for the delivery effort, he said.\n",
      "Olsavsky added that spending on video would rise going forward, but the company was still determining its overall level of investment for 2020.\n",
      "Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said in a statement that the world's biggest online retailer now has more than 150 million paid members in its loyalty club Prime, a 50% increase from its last disclosure in April 2018.\n",
      "Subscribers keep returning to Amazon to benefit from perks like fast delivery, television and music streaming. Its suite of voice-controlled Echo speakers has prompted still more engagement from customers, and grocery orders more than doubled in the holiday quarter in a vote of confidence for Amazon's 2017 bet to buy Whole Foods Market.\n",
      "This formula has helped make Bezos the richest person in the world.\n",
      "Amazon is hoping that cutting delivery times to one day for Prime members will let it outmaneuver rivals such as Walmart Inc that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees. The company made progress in the holiday season, reporting that it quadrupled one-day and same-day deliveries over the year-ago quarter.\n",
      "Revenue from subscription fees grew 32% to $5.2 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, as more shoppers signed up for Prime than in any period prior.\n",
      "WATCHING CORONAVIRUS\n",
      "Net sales rose 21% to $87.4 billion while net income rose 8% to $3.3 billion - each over $1 billion more than analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n",
      "The profit rise reflects the evolving nature of Amazon's business. The company has been moving away from low-margin retail toward a marketplace model where it takes lucrative fees for shipping and advertising the products of other merchants on its platform.\n",
      "This has helped weather massive spending at Amazon, a company that has long passed up short-term results in favor of bets that could reap it future profit.\n",
      "For instance, faster delivery has meant a surge in hiring and related costs. The company said its full-time and part-time headcount rose 23% to 798,000 in the quarter, as it expanded both fulfillment and corporate software roles.\n",
      "Expenses similarly grew as the company moved inventory closer to customers and built out its last-mile delivery network, which now handles the biggest share of Amazon-ordered packages in the United States. Amazon said worldwide shipping costs rose 43% to $12.9 billion.\n",
      "Amazon Web Services (AWS) also has seen infrastructure and marketing costs rise. The unit responsible for selling data storage and computing power in the cloud lost out to Microsoft Corp in a high-profile deal last quarter to sell technology to the U.S. Department of Defense, in what could have netted the company $10 billion over a decade. Amazon is contesting the contract decision.\n",
      "Microsoft on Wednesday reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales for its Azure cloud computing service. Yet Amazon posted better results than feared, growing revenue 34% to $9.95 billion, similar to its third-quarter increase.\n",
      "\"This is important because it ends six quarters of measurable decline in AWS growth, reassuring investors that the segment has signs of stability,\" Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said in a research note.\n",
      "Amazon's international business also narrowed losses to $617 million in the fourth quarter. The company has less exposure to China than Apple Inc and other technology industry peers, which may help it weather economic uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of the coronavirus.\n",
      "Olsavsky said Amazon is watching the situation very carefully and is starting to put China travel restrictions on employees. The company considers China to be a far less strategic market than India, which CEO Bezos visited earlier this month partly to announce a new $1 billion investment in the country.\n",

      "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejected calls from a medical union on Friday to close the border with mainland China to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, and urged health staff not to go through with a threatened strike.\n",
      "The recently formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said earlier on Friday 6,500 of its members would go on strike if the frontier stayed open, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global emergency.\n",

      "About 37,000 Hong Kongers crossed the mainland border the other way into China that day, she said.\n",
      "NEW MEASURES\n",
      "The health scare comes after months of often violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong triggered by fears its high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, is being eroded by Beijing. The central government denies meddling.\n",
      "Protesters frustrated by the government's refusal to make concessions on demands for full democracy have in recent months formed about 40 unions to keep up the pressure on the authorities.\n",
      "In a news conference earlier on Friday, Winnie Yu, the chairwoman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, said its members may go a strike next week unless the border was closed. Other new unions have pledged support.\n",
      "Lam had previously ordered the suspension of the high-speed rail service between the city and mainland China and all cross-border ferry services, but the unions said it was not enough.\n",
      "The new measures announced on Friday included checks on people's temperatures as they left Hong Kong.\n",

It is directed at less developed countries such as India where modern health care is not as widely available, she said.\n",
      "Canada’s measures were set up 10 days ago, and that means B.C. and other Pacific Rim regions are at a “critical stage,” where travellers would be starting to show symptoms of coronavirus, Henry said. The incubation period for the new virus has been averaging five days, and most infected people would notice they are ill after 10 days.\n",
      "The B.C. Centre for Disease Control has a frequently updated web page on the novel coronavirus. As of Friday, it reported that outside of mainland China, there have been 152 confirmed cases and no deaths.\n",
      "The first B.C. patient continues to be stable and recovering at home, and testing will continue with any suspected cases to stop it spreading, as was done with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) when it emerged in 2003, said Henry, who worked on the SARS epidemic.\n",

      "Henry said the new virus is believed to have been transmitted from animals to humans as a result of the large animal and seafood markets in Wuhan, the Chinese city where it was first identified. The intensive measures being taken around the world are to contain and eradicate the strain from the human population.\n",
      "Henry said the effort is directed at the new coronavirus because it has the potential to become another type of influenza that circulates every year, and can be fatal for people with compromised health who are exposed.\n",
      "“The reason is because this is a new virus that has just jumped the species barrier,” Henry said. “We have one opportunity as a global community to push this back, and that opportunity is now.”\n",

      "Tweet: Student debt is putting a damper on young Americans' relationship decisions, according to a new study from private lender LendKey Technologies. About one-third of respondents between ages 18 and 34 say they might postpone marriage — or have already done so — until student debt is paid off, according to the study, which surveyed 1,037 U.S. adults who attended college. The study was given to USA TODAY exclusively. That number shrank among older respondents. About 17% of those between 35 and 54 would postpone marriage and 10% of those 55 and older would delay it. Debt also affected partner choices. Get involved!: Who inspires you? USA TODAY seeks your Women of the Century Coronavirus: Businesses restrict travel to China as economic fallout spreads Just over one-third of millennial and Gen Z respondents say a potential partner's student or credit card balances could affect their choice of a spouse, depending on the amount of debt. Twenty percent say they'd be fine with student loan debt but not credit debt, while 6% say the reverse. Just 4% say any amount of debt was a dealbreaker. Roughly 36% of the people surveyed say debt wouldn't factor into marital decisions. \"Student debt is something millennials have to think about when considering marriage,\" says Vince Passione, chief executive at LendKey. \"It's not just affecting their wallets, it's also affecting the way they view relationships.\" A separate study shows that more than 50% of dating millennials don’t want to marry until their finances are in order, according to a recent survey from Credit Karma. Almost two-thirds of those surveyed millennials who were in a relationship have a separate bank account from their significant other. And nearly one-third say that keeping at least one bank account separate from their partner’s helps keep their relationship alive. Borrowers of all ages currently owe roughly $1.5 trillion in student loans, according to the Brookings Institution. About 42 million Americans have student loans, which are the second-largest portion of household debt after mortgages. Taxes 2020: When to file and what changes to expect FICO scores: The 'most important numbers in your financial life,' are about to change LendKey's survey also found a lack of financial literacy around student loans. Just 16% of respondents between 18-34 say they have \"shopped around” for the best rate and terms for a student loan. By contrast, two-thirds overall shopped for the best rates and terms for cars, 60% for insurance and 57% for vacations. The data suggests that students need a greater understanding of the loan process, says Passione of LendKey. About 41% say they believed loans came from the schools themselves, while 14% incorrectly guessed angel investors are providing loans to the public. Millennial and Gen Z borrowers were more likely than older generations to believe that a government program will eventually relieve their burden.\n",

The Atlanta-based carrier will continue to operate flights until Feb. 5 to ensure customers looking to leave China can do so. Thirty minutes after Delta's announcement, Dallas-based American Airlines suspended flights to China through March 27. The decision comes a day after the U.S. State Department advised its citizens not to travel to China and to leave so as soon as possible. Dozens of global carriers in recent days have reduced or canceled flights to China, which is in the throes of a public health crisis. Chicago-based United Airlines, which has the largest Asia network of the three major U.S. carriers, severely curtailed its China flights Thursday, reducing daily departures between the U.S. and mainland China and Hong Kong from 12 to 4. United initially canceled 24 flights for the first week of February, announcing an additional 332 suspensions Thursday on flights scheduled between Feb. 9 and March 28. Delta's last flight to China from the U.S. will leave Monday, Feb. 3. The last return flight departing China on Feb. 5. \"The airline will continue to monitor the situation closely and may make additional adjustments as the situation continues to evolve,\" Delta said. The carrier currently operates 42 flights a week between the U.S. and China. Travelers with flights already booked can request a refund or reschedule their trips for after April 30.\n",

      "RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) \" Jarred Evans, a professional football player in China, is used to wearing a helmet and shoulder pads. But in the wake of a deadly viral outbreak, he's switched to a mask and medical gloves.\n",
      "'When you're dealing with life and death, it's a whole different ball game,\" he said in a telephone interview Thursday.\n",
      "Evans, 27, was one of 195 Americans evacuated from the city of Wuhan and flown to March Air Reserve Base in Southern California until authorities confirm they don't have the coronavirus that has sickened thousands and killed more than 170 people.\n",
      "Most cases are in China, but the outbreak has spread to more than a dozen countries, and the World Health Organization declared a global emergency Thursday.\n",
      "The U.S. on Thursday confirmed the country's first case of person-to-person spread of the virus, a man who is married to a Chicago woman in her 60s who got sick after she returned from a trip to Wuhan.\n",
      "Evans and the other evacuees, including children ranging from around a year old to about 13, are staying at the sprawling base where they received a battery of blood tests and were given nose, throat and mouth swabs, Evans said. Some test results won't be back for a week, he added.\n",
      "While the surroundings are fairly comfortable, Evans said Thursday that he and others are still being cautious about mingling.\n",
      "'I'm still wearing my mask and I'm still wearing my gloves,\" he said in a telephone interview. 'We're still not knowing who has it. I'm still taking major precautions. You don't know whether you're in the clear.'\n",
      "'Today a lot of kids were enjoying the weather,' he said, and the base provided scooters, bikes, footballs and soccer balls for them to play with.\n",
      "But at dinnertime, Evans added, 'everyone's getting their food and going right back to their rooms.'\n",
      "Those being held at the base 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Los Angeles arrived Wednesday morning. They aren't required to stay but had agreed to remain for at least 72 hours. Officials also can quarantine any of those evacuated on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "That happened to another American who tried to leave Wednesday night.\n",
      "Officials in Riverside County ordered the person quarantined for two weeks unless medically cleared sooner, said Jose Arballo Jr., a spokesman for the county's public health agency.\n",
      "The order was issued 'as a result of the unknown risk to the public\" because the person had not undergone a complete health evaluation, the agency said.\n",
      "It can take up to 14 days for someone who is infected to develop symptoms, health officials believe. None of the Americans housed at base have shown symptoms of the virus since their arrival, Arballo said.\n",

      "Friends translated the news for Evans, who speaks no Chinese.\n",
      "'I stocked up on rice, noodles, water, anything that could help me survive for a week or two,' Evans said.\n",
      "The Chinese government shut down the city. Buses, trains, taxis, and personal cars were banned. The military patrolled some streets.\n",
      "'That's when people, honestly, stayed locked in their homes,' Evans said.\n",
      "He compared the deserted city to an Old West ghost town.\n",
      "'I've never experienced anything like this before,\" he said. 'Imagine new York city being shut down. I was completely scared at first, because I didn't know exactly what was going to happen. I don't speak the language, and my family is so far away.'\n",
      "Evans holed up in his home for a week and a half until he received the news that the U.S. Embassy was evacuating its diplomats and their families and other U.S. citizens.\n",
      "He was notified that a chartered flight was carrying some of the 1,000 or so Americans in Wuhan back to the United States. The flight was coming in the next day.\n",
      "Evans said he was told, 'If you can make it there, you're on the flight.'\n",
      "'It was a race against time,\" he said.\n",
      "Evans found an acquaintance who drove him to the airport. The embassy notified Chinese authorities of the license plate number so he could pass through the guarded streets.\n",
      "Evans said he was No. 171 out of 195 people permitted on board.\n",
      "On the plane were two men in full hazardous material suits, who warned them about the seriousness of the outbreak. Nobody appeared sick but all of the passengers decided to wear masks throughout the flight, Evans said.\n",
      "The plane flew to Anchorage, where the passengers had health screenings, and then landed at March Reserve Air Base on Wednesday morning. The U.S. arrival was joyful, Evans said.\n",

The main stock indexes were on course to round off the week on a poor note as the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic a global emergency. The fast-spreading virus has killed more than 200 people in China and infected thousands globally, while disrupting supply chains and curbing travel, prompting Wall Street economists to temper their growth expectations for the country. Fitch Solutions said it maintained its real GDP growth forecast for China at 5.9% for 2020, but said it could drop to 5.4% because of the virus. However, the fourth-quarter earnings season has been largely positive, with Refinitiv data showing a 0.7% rise in profit for S&P 500 companies that reported earnings through Thursday, compared with a 0.6% decline estimated at the start of the season. Amazon.com Inc surged 10.5% in premarket trading after it trumped Wall Street estimates for holiday-quarter results, putting the online retailer back in the $1 trillion market capitalization club. At 7:31 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 101 points, or 0.35%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 11 points, or 0.33% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 22.25 points, or 0.24%. Western Digital Corp jumped 4.6% after forecasting third-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations, while International Business Machines Corp gained 4.1% after naming a new chief executive officer. Caterpillar Inc was down 1.8% after the industrial conglomerate forecast full-year earnings below analysts' expectations as it struggles with sluggish global industrial activity. Visa Inc fell 2.7% as it fell short of analysts' estimate for first-quarter revenue and warned revenue would be crimped by incentives it provide to banking clients in 2020.

A female student of a university in the Chinese city of Wuhan , the epicentre of the outbreak, has tested positive for the virus that killed 170 people in China and is spreading worldwide.\n",
      "Health minister K K Shailaja said the student was hospitalised after she developed symptoms of fever and sore throat and she was quarantined, along with four others, in the isolation ward of the general hospital in Thrissur. “The student who has been tested positive for the virus is stable; there is nothing to worry,” she said.\n",

      "Premier Li Keqiang called on Thursday for expedited steps to research and develop vaccines and effective pharmaceuticals against the novel coronavirus, in an effort to improve medical treatment and reduce the mortality rate of the pneumonia-causing virus.\n",
      "Li's remarks came as he visited the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing and presided over a symposium with health experts.\n",
      "The safety and the health of the people must be placed first and foremost, he said.\n",
      "The China CDC should devote every minute to finding the source of the novel virus and its transmission and pathogenic mechanism and accelerate research on vaccines, he said.\n",
      "He also urged the national public health institute to respond to public concerns and doubts in a timely manner and improve the public's capacity and awareness for self-protection.\n",
      "The premier commended the major contribution made by health workers nationwide for staying at the front line in the war against the outbreak, and fighting for the health of the people.\n",
      "The key to winning the battle against the outbreak is improving the effectiveness of medical treatment and lowering its mortality rate, he said.\n",
      "Vaccines and effective pharmaceuticals are the nemesis of the novel virus, and a clear understanding of the virus is required in order to overcome it, he said.\n",
      "He called for more coordination nationwide to unite experts from different areas and disciplines in order to enhance research and clinical cooperation.\n",
      "It is important to speed up the screening and application of clinical drugs and the development of reagents that can confirm infections as well as vaccines and effective drugs, he said.\n",
      "He urged the authorities to organize top researchers to conduct in-depth research of the diagnosis of cases and patient treatment in order to summarize treatment experience and enable the improvement of treatment plans and the timely sharing of this information.\n",
      "Li expressed his hope that health experts can step up research and analysis of the novel virus, keep monitoring its latest developments and offer professional support to more targeted measures for epidemic control and prevention.\n",
      "He called for scientific standards to be made in terms of individual protection, work protection, medical protection and the segregation of suspected cases. These standards must vary based on different areas, venues and sectors, he added.\n",
      "The premier stressed the necessity to dispatch and use medical protection resources in a scientific manner and ensure that they could be used where they are needed most.\n",
      "He also cautioned against hiding or underreporting the number of infections, saying that information on the epidemic must be made public transparently.\n",

      "Tweet: Hong Kong (CNN Business) Facebook ( FB ) says it will start taking down bogus claims about purported \"cures\" and other unproven theories surrounding the coronavirus, as the deadly outbreak continues to spread globally, sparking a surge in online chatter and misinformation .\n",
      "The company will \"remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them,\" according to a blog post published Thursday by Kang-Xing Jin, Facebook's head of health. Jin said that includes claims \"related to false cures or prevention methods\" or \"that create confusion about health resources that are available.\" As coronavirus spreads, so does online misinformation The company also plans to increase its fact-checking and monitoring efforts on Instagram, which it also owns. Jin said users who click on a hashtag related to the coronavirus will now be served with a \"pop-up with credible information.\" The social network wants to prioritize legitimate sources of information, Jin said, by letting select organizations run free ads that help educate people about the virus and also boosting posts that fall in line with health experts' guidance to the top of users' Facebook feeds. It did not specify which organizations would be included. Read More Jin noted in the Thursday blog post that not all the new measures were \"fully in place\" yet. \"It will take some time to roll them out across our platforms and step up our enforcement methods,\" he wrote. \"We're focusing on claims that are designed to discourage treatment or taking appropriate precautions.\" The move is Silicon Valley's latest attempt to combat misinformation about the outbreak, which has infected more than 9,800 people around the world and killed more than 200 in mainland China. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday declared the outbreak \"a public health emergency of international concern.\" Twitter and Google have also stepped up efforts this week to guide their users to verified sources on the subject. Google ( GOOGL ) announced Thursday that when people search for information about the coronavirus, it will pull up a special notice with updates from the WHO. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said it will promote videos from credible sources when people search for clips about the virus. The company said it specifically points to content from trusted users, such as public health experts or news outlets, in search results or panels that suggest which videos to watch next. Twitter ( TWTR ) said Wednesday that it would begin prompting users who search for the coronavirus to first visit official channels of information about the illness. In the United States, for example, Twitter directs users to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, beneath a bold headline that reads: \"Know the facts.\" The campaign is running in 15 locations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia, and \"will continue to expand as the need arises,\" the company said in a blog post . Looking for the latest information about the novel #coronavirus ?\n",
      "We've recently adjusted our search prompt to ensure authoritative health sources appear upfront when you search on Twitter👇 #knowthefacts pic.twitter.com/LlYUAdLSBy\n",
      "— Twitter Singapore (@TwitterSG) January 29, 2020 As of Wednesday, Twitter said that it had already seen more than 15 million tweets about the coronavirus in four weeks, \"and that trend looks set to continue.\" A company spokesperson told CNN Business earlier this week that it had not seen a coordinated increase in disinformation related to the virus, but would \"remain vigilant\" on the issue. The moves this week are notable, particularly since social networks have long been criticized for allowing the spread of misinformation. Facebook, which now claims about 2.5 billion monthly users on its flagship network and a combined 2.9 billion monthly active users across its other apps like WhatsApp and Instagram, has had major problems restricting hoaxes about vaccines, for example. Instagram last year vowed to block more hashtags that surfaced vaccine misinformation after a CNN Business report found that content promoted by anti-vaccination accounts were still thriving on the platform. While the company frequently touts its army of fact-checkers and reviewers who are paid to debunk false claims, the effectiveness of its policies remain in question. On Thursday, some people pointed out that a search for \"vaccines\" on Instagram still brought up several pages linked to dangerous misinformation. Yikes. Just checked Instagram and got same results. https://t.co/Qwr812xknV\n",

      "The deadly Coronavirus outbreak that has already killed 213 people in China could lead to delay in the accessories for the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S20 series that are coming out of the country. According to the website MobileFun, it has already started receiving emails from a variety of brands and suppliers detailing delays that could make it very difficult for early S20 adopters to purchase cases, screen protectors and other device specific accessories at launch. Samsung's flagship \"Unpacked\" event a under two weeks away but, the spread of the Wuhan Coronavirus and the subsequent extension of the Chinese New Year holiday by the Chinese government will have consequences for the upcoming smartphones and their potential buyers. With the majority of phone cases and glass screen protectors manufactured in China, including the extremely popular, Samsung partnered Whitestone Dome, owners of the new S20 phones will likely have to wait in order provide their phone with enhanced protection, the report added. Earlier this week, there were reports that the deadly virus could also impact Apple's business as its Foxconn facility in Wuhan \"could quickly become overrun with an outbreak, potentially putting workers at unnecessary risk and effectively shutting down production\". In addition to asking many employees to stay at home, the Taiwanese multinational electronics contract manufacturing firm has also enhanced employee health monitoring at the Wuhan factory. Tags\n",

      "Tweet: The global cost of the coronavirus could be three or four times that of the 2003 Sars outbreak that sapped the world’s economy by $40 billion, according to the economist who calculated that figure.\n",
      "The sheer growth in the Chinese economy over the last 17 years means the global health emergency triggered by the coronavirus outbreak has far greater potential to gouge global growth, according to Warwick McKibbin, professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n",
      "Read: WHO declares China virus outbreak an international emergency\n",
      "“It’s just a mathematical thing,” McKibbin said in a phone interview. “Most of the GDP loss that we saw in the Sars model, and in reality, was China slowing down. And so, with China much bigger, you’d expect the billions would be much bigger.”\n",
      "While difficult to pinpoint a precise cost as the crisis is still unfolding, the impact will be experienced mostly through changes in “human psychology,” he said. “Panic is what seems to be the biggest drain on the economy, rather than deaths.”\n",
      "Markets have been whipsawed by panic, Paris-based Amundi Asset Management said in a Jan. 29 note. chief investment officer Pascal Blanque and his deputy Vincent Mortier said the novel coronavirus provided the trigger for a pause in a stock market rally that began in October.\n",
      "McKibbin’s forecasts are in line with those of other analysts.\n",
      "Nomura International expects the blow to China’s growth could exceed that seen during the Sars outbreak. Real GDP growth in the first quarter could “materially drop” from the 6% pace in the fourth quarter, maybe by even more than the 2 percentage point deceleration seen in the second quarter of 2003 from the first, Nomura economists led by Lu Ting wrote in a report to clients.\n",
      "What Bloomberg’s economists say …\n",
      "“Back in 2003, China accounted for just 4% of global GDP. Fast forward to 2020, and its share has increased to 17%. That means the global spillover if China’s growth slumps will be larger.”\n",
      "“Hong Kong stands out as the most exposed — our simulation shows a hit of 1.7 ppts in the first quarter. South Korea and Vietnam would also suffer, each slowing by 0.4 ppt. Japan would take a 0.2 ppt hit.” –Chang Shu, Jamie Rush and Tom Orlik\n",
      "More contagious than Sars but less deadly, the insidious nature of the coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, is such that it often presents as mild cold-like symptoms and can go undetected, which could potentially protract out the crisis for longer than the 2003 epidemic.\n",
      "The new virus, which emerged in central China in late 2019, is reported to have infected almost 10 000 people in two months, eclipsing the 8 096 Sars cases reported from November 2002 through 2003, when the contagion spread from China across Southeast Asia and to North America and Europe.\n",
      "“If a country had a bad epidemiological outcome, then their shocks were likely be a lot bigger than countries that were able to control it well,” McKibbin said, referring to his findings from examining the impact of Sars.\n",

      "BEIJING — The World Health Organization declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in China that has been exported to more than a dozen countries as a global emergency Thursday after the number of cases spiked tenfold in a week.\n",
      "The U.N. health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a co-ordinated international response.\n",
      "China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.\n",
      "Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading g among people in China and have noted with concern several instances in other countries – including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam – where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.\n",
      "The case in France is a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus and later became infected himself. The doctor is now being treated in an isolated room at a Paris hospital. Outbreak specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission.\n",
      "A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.\n",
      "On Thursday, China raised the death toll to 170 and more countries reported infections, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from China’s worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation.\n",
      "Russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak. It had been de facto closed because of the Lunar New Year holiday, but Russian authorities said the closure would be extended until March 1.\n",
      "Train traffic between the countries was halted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air traffic between the two countries continued, at least for now. Russia has not confirmed any cases of the virus.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus. The man in the U.S. is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak.\n",
      "There have been cases reported of the infectious virus spreading to others in a household or workplace in China and elsewhere. The case in South Korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier.\n",
      "The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, a cousin of the new virus.\n",
      "The latest figures for mainland China show an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,736 confirmed cases. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, and one was in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Outside China, there are 82 infections in 18 countries, according to WHO.\n",
      "China extended its Lunar New Year holiday to Sunday to try to keep people home, but the wave of returning travellers could potentially cause the virus to spread further.\n",
      "Transport ministry spokesman Wu Chungeng outlined a series of rigorous temperature checks and other “severe measures” to detect possibly infectious passengers. Transport restrictions such as those isolating Wuhan and suspending inter-provincial bus services would remain in place, Wu said.\n",
      "“It’s definitely very challenging, but we’re confident we can exert effective control,” Wu told reporters at the briefing.\n",
      "To date, about 99 per cent of the cases are in China. Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at two per cent, but said the figure was very preliminary. With fluctuating numbers of cases and deaths, scientists are only able to produce a rough estimate of the fatality rate and it’s likely many milder cases of the virus are being missed.\n",
      "In comparison, the SARS virus killed about 10 per cent of people who caught it. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS.\n",
      "Chinese authorities have demanded anyone who travelled from or through Wuhan report to health authorities and self-quarantine themselves for 14 days, the maximum incubation period during which patients can be infectious even if they don’t show symptoms.\n",
      "China has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumours — a reflection of the one-party Communist state’s determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media.\n",
      "That stands in stark contrast to the initial response to SARS, when medical reports were hidden as state secrets. The delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide, killing around 800 people.\n",

      "It didn’t take long for the S&P 500 to suffer a swift 3% decline, with the index touching technical support around the 3,250 level, as we noted last week.\n",

Recently, there has been options betting taking place in the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: EEM ) and the iShares China ETF (NYSE: FXI ). The options activity for both ETFs seemed to have picked up in recent days suggesting that the two ETF’s rise in the weeks ahead, acting as a bet that is clearly against the grain.\n",
      "Finding Strong Support\n",
      "The S&P 500 fell sharply starting last Friday as headlines of the coronavirus first started to spread. It didn’t take long for the index to fall, dropping by just over 3% from the Jan. 22 highs to the Jan. 27 lows. But the S&P 500 has found a substantial level of technical support around the 3,245 level, which has been acting as a floor for the index.

      "It would seem that the general uptrend in the market has not been damaged either. The S&P 500 has been steadily climbing in a tight trading channel since the beginning of October and has essentially been able to hold that trend line. Additionally, the relative strength index is trending higher off its December 2018 lows. It would indicate that long-term momentum favors markets rising.\n",

On Jan. 29, the open interest for the EEM Feb. 28 $45 calls rose by almost 100,000 contracts. The data shows that contracts were bought, with the trader paying about $0.35.\n",
      "This means that for the buyer of the calls to earn a profit, the EEM would need to rise to $45.35 or higher if holding the contracts until the expiration date. That would amount to a gain of about 5.5% from the EEM’s current price of approximately $43 on Jan. 30.\n",
      "Additionally, the open interest for the FXI March 20, $45 calls saw their open interest levels rise by over 92,000 contracts on Jan. 27. The data also show that the contracts traded on the ASK for about $0.50.\n",
      "In this case, the ETF would need to rise to $45.50 or higher to earn a profit if the buyer holds the contracts until expiration. The ETF would need to increase by around 12% from its current price of approximately $45.60.\n",
      "The bets would seem to suggest that some see the market recovering much, if not all of its losses from the recent downdraft. It could even serve as further confirmation the U.S. equity markets are poised to bounce in the days ahead, resuming their current uptrends, in line with the technical charts.\n",
      "Risks Remain\n",
      "However, there seems to be a looming risk, which is always present in the equity market. However, should prices reverse and decline below the 3,245 level on the S&P 500, it would likely deal a crushing blow to the index, potentially pushing it lower towards 3,150.\n",

The Coast Guard will continue to review all “Notice of Arrivals” in accordance with current policies and will communicate any concerns stemming from sick or deceased crew or passengers to their Coast Guard chain of command and the CDC quarantine station who will coordinate with local health authorities. Vessel masters shall inform Coast Guard boarding teams of any ill crewmembers on board their vessel prior to the Coast Guard embarking and Boarding Teams should verify vessel illnesses with CDC if concerns arise. Local industry stakeholders, in partnership with their Coast Guard Captain of the Port, should review and be familiar with section 5310 Procedures for Vessel Quarantine and Isolation, and Section 5320 - Procedures for Security Segregation of Vessels in their Area Maritime Security Plan. Local industry stakeholders, in partnership with their Coast Guard Captain of the Port, should review and be familiar with their Marine Transportation System Recovery Plan.\n",

      "Tweet: The 42 skeletons found on a local building site may date back to Anglo Saxon times – and they could be the nation's biggest historical burial from that period.\n",
      "We exclusively revealed earlier this week that human skeletons, with their hands bound behind their backs, had been dug up from farmland in Buckingham set to be developed as a retirement living complex. Generic editorial image for illustrative purposes only. Photo: Archive\n",
      "But the matter appeared to have been “hushed up”, with the developers remaining silent.\n",
      "Today the Bucks County Council Cabinet member Bill Chapple, said it could take months to discover how old the human remains are.\n",
      "“Details such as the age and gender of those buried, their origins, health, illnesses and cause of death can take some months to undertake,” he said.\n",
      "But it is understood that a small number of artefacts were also excavated, and these can be much easier to date, say experts. The burial ground at West End Far\n",
      "Buckingham's resident historian Ed Grimsdale says the fact that the skeletons' hands were bound indicates they were prisoners who had been executed.\n",
      "During Anglo Saxon times prisoners were buried together in mass graves, away from the rest of the dead. But after the Norman conquest of 1066, burials became more inclusive and prisoners were buried alongside the rest of the community.\n",
      "Mr Grimsdale believes one possible date could be November 13 1002, the day of the St Brice's Day massacre when hundreds of Danes were killed.\n",
      "“This was ordered by the son of Alfred the Great, King Æthelred the Unready. We know that a massacre happened in Oxford and Buckingham was designated as a burh – a outpost to act as a look out and warn of invasions. Perhaps another massacre happened there,\" he said. One of the graves\n",
      "Methodology and DNA tests should be able to ascertain whether the skeletons were local victims of such a massacre, or whether they were the 'enemy' and of Scandinavian descent.\n",
      "“If these skeletons do date back to Anglo Saxon times, then this burial ground would be of huge historical significance. It would be the biggest such burial found in the UK, possibly the world,” said Mr Grimsdale.\n",
      "He, like many local people, is concerned that the matter appears to have been hushed up, and believes the town should have been informed when the skeletons were found in December, several weeks ago.\n",
      "“Such secrecy in such circumstances tends to say there is something being hidden,” he said. The site is next to the cemetery\n",
      "Another theory is that the skeletons were criminals hanged in public executions in the county town of Aylesbury.\n",
      "\"In those days people could be executed for stealing a few pence. One man was hanged for stealing a goat,\" said Mr Grimsdale.\n",
      "This week, people are also wondering whether a mysterious excavation in the nearby Brackley Road cemetery three years ago was linked to the skeletons.\n",
      "A police forensic investigation was launched at a Buckingham cemetery in Febraury 2017 after “ unknown human remains” were found near a grave.\n",
      "An investigation into the remains, believed to be part of a skull, was launched by archaeologists and part of the graveyard was sealed off as a potential crime scene.\n",
      "The results of the investigation were never made public, but it was said the remains were of an archeological nature.\n",
      "Mr Grimsdale said: “I'm now wondering if they came from this burial site. Perhaps somebody dug them up and decided to put them in the cemetery. It seems very strange.”\n",
      "Meanwhile councillor Chapple OBE has promised the results will be presented in a report from the archaeological specialist consultant once work is complete.\n",
      "\"This is obviously a very important site for Buckingham, with a fascinating story, and we look forward to sharing the results once we have them,\" he said.\n",
      "Today, Places for People, who are the developers on the site, are still failing to comment. They passed the Citizen to their London PR company called Oracle, but that company has also failed to provide a comment.

The earliest cases of the disease are tied to a meat market in the city, before it began spreading around the globe. And today the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak is an international public health emergency.\n",
      "AILSA CHANG, HOST:\n",
      "Here in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first person-to-person transmission of the virus. Public health officials encouraged Americans to take basic precautions - wash your hands, cover your sneezes and coughs. But they note the odds of contracting the virus in the U.S. are extremely low.\n",
      "KELLY: Not so in Wuhan - residents there are told to wear face masks whenever they leave their homes. They're not allowed to leave the city. Public transit is shut down.\n",
      "I spoke earlier today to Pisso Nseke. He's a business consultant who has lived in Wuhan for five years. I asked, when did he last leave his house?\n",
      "PISSO NSEKE: So the last time I left my home was about five days ago. There were no cars. There were no buses. We could only see one or two people. It's, like, literally a ghost town.\n",
      "KELLY: Are restaurants open? Are stores open?\n",
      "NSEKE: Restaurants are not open because all public meetings, parties or anything that can bring people are greatly discouraged. So the only thing that people can do is just to go to the supermarket and buy food and supplies.\n",
      "KELLY: OK. So the supermarkets are open. Do they have food? Is there - are there things on the shelves?\n",
      "NSEKE: So some supermarkets have food, but other supermarkets lack vegetables. Like, because of the coronavirus, some people are scared of eating anything like beef, you know? So most people now are trying to eat, like, vegetables, so it's kind of difficult to get vegetables.\n",
      "KELLY: And where are you getting your news about what's happening?\n",
      "NSEKE: I try to get my news from different sources - from the local media, also from the national media. And I also try to see what foreign medias are talking about.\n",
      "KELLY: So you're comparing Chinese media and international.\n",
      "NSEKE: Exactly. I can tell you, like, sometimes, some of the information are not the same. Like, in the beginning of the crisis, you know, the foreign media was presenting it as more serious. But after that, I think the Chinese president asked for more transparency and stronger measures. So I think now there's a little bit more transparency.\n",
      "KELLY: So do you feel like you have enough information - like you're getting accurate facts about what's going on in your city?\n",
      "NSEKE: Well, I'll be very honest. I really don't know what to think right now because sometimes, you have the feeling they're telling you that things are going to get under control. But when you look at the statistics - the number of people infected and the number of people dying - it just keeps on increasing, you know?\n",
      "KELLY: Are you scared?\n",
      "NSEKE: I'm not really scared. I'm just concerned because I don't have all of the information. I don't have all of the data, so it's very difficult for me to know exactly what to expect because we're just like sitting ducks, you know? We don't really know what's happening.\n",
      "KELLY: I suppose you can't possibly know the answer to this. But how long can this go on? How long can you hold out without being able to leave your house?\n",
      "NSEKE: Honestly speaking, this is the first time in my life - I'm a very active person, and this is the first time I have to stay this long. In the beginning, it was kind of fun because we could watch, like, movies...\n",
      "KELLY: (Laughter).\n",
      "NSEKE: ...You know? - like, watch some Netflix, you know? But now it's, like, terrifying because you don't know how long this is going to last. So it's more psychological.\n",
      "KELLY: What are you eating at this point? What's in the fridge?\n",
      "NSEKE: Some vegetables - I got some rice because rice is one of the cheapest things in China. I also made sure to buy a lot of water. I got some potatoes, and that's what I have.\n",
      "KELLY: Yeah.\n",
      "Do you have a family? Are you stuck in the house by yourself?\n",
      "NSEKE: I'm stuck in the house by myself.\n",

      "NSEKE: I'm not married yet. It's all right.\n",
      "KELLY: (Laughter) Not yet.\n",
      "KELLY: And it's - I'm guessing it's hard to meet somebody under these situations.\n",
      "(LAUGHTER)\n",
      "NSEKE: Yeah, it's kind of hard. It's kind of hard. You know, it's - and people are advised not to couple up or meet each other because there are risks of contaminating somebody. So this is some kind of house arrest, self-quarantine. And it's not really easy for a lot of people.\n",

      "American Airlines announced Wednesday that it was suspending daily flights between Los Angeles International Airport and Shanghai Pudong Airport as well as LAX and Beijing Capital International Airport from Feb. 9 to March 27.\n",
      "In addition to those flights, American Airlines operates daily round-trip routes between LAX and Hong Kong as well as daily round-trip routes between Dallas/Fort Worth and Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong.\n",

      "The union representing the flight attendants on American Airlines issued a statement Thursday supporting the lawsuit.\n",
      "\"Every precaution must be taken to safeguard the health of our American Airlines crew members and passengers,\" said Lori Bassani, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents 28,000 flight attendants at the airline. \"Until we know more and can be sure that all crew and passengers will be safe from this quickly spreading illness, we are urgently calling on American Airlines and the federal government to err on the side of caution and halt all flights to and from China.\"\n",
      "\"Our safety is not for sale. We stand with our pilots.\"\n",
      " The World Health Organization announced Thursday that the outbreak had spread to more than a dozen countries, describing it as an \"extraordinary event\" after the number of cases soared tenfold in a week.\n",
      "The outbreak has played havoc with the airline industry, which has in the past few years increased its flights to and from China to serve a growing middle class with a taste for international travel and big-budget spending. The average Chinese tourist spends more than $6,000 per trip to the U.S., according to the U.S. Travel Association.\n",
      "In response to the outbreak, Delta Air Lines cut daily flights to Beijing and Shanghai in half, down to 21 flights a week, between Feb. 6 and April 30, and includes LAX to Shanghai flights. United Airlines announced it would cut 24 flights between hub cities in the U.S. and China, starting Saturday through Feb. 8 to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai.\n",
      "British Airways and Asian budget carriers Lion Air and Seoul Air suspended flights to China while several other airlines -- including Finnair, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific and Singapore-based Jetstar Asia -- reduced the number of flights.\n",
      "The lawsuit by the Allied Pilots Association said flight crews are required to stay on the ground in China for 32 hours between flights to comply with federal rest regulations. The lawsuit said the flights and the time spent in China create \"potential exposure.\"\n",

      "The use of face masks is common in China, to protect against both germs and pollution. But when Chinese immigrants wear them in the U.S., it often conflicts with guidance from officials, who warn that they offer minimal protection and could lull wearers into a false sense of security. It can also draw suspicious gazes from passersby.\n",

The order was later expanded to the entire Hubei province, affecting nearly 56 million people. Now a week has passed. What does Wuhan look like under quarantine? How has the city's population been handling it?\n",

All of this almost feels like a scene out of a zombie movie.\n",
      "I try to distract myself and keep my mind fresh: I read books, I make podcasts, I watch films, trying my best to make sure this whole mess doesn't get me. But sometimes, in this repetitive daily routine, we start to forget what we used to and aspire to be. This epidemic has taken a toll on all of us.\n",
      "The memory of waking up to a city completely sealed off remains fresh. \"Dumbstruck\" is probably the best word to describe how I felt. This had never happened - not in my life, not in my parents'.\n",
      "Fear and anxiety Having seen what the SARS outbreak did, this still is the first time we all became nervous. That's also when I realised the situation had gone way beyond what the official facade looked like. In the first days following the lockdown, I was overwhelmed, but more afraid, I guess.\n",
      "The morning of the lockdown, many private cars were trying to get out of Wuhan. But all my family is in Wuhan and it made no sense for me to leave. Instead, I rushed out to get more masks, but at that time, the supply for masks had already dwindled significantly - many pharmacies had run out of them. That's when I first started to freak out - what if I couldn't get them? What if I or someone in my family got infected?\n",

I was going crazy - it's ironic that when I was working, I always wanted to stay at home and rest, but now that I am spending almost my entire time at home, it feels like torture.\n",

The only little \"entertainment\" for him is to take a look at this empty road and do nothing.\n",
      "Whenever I get bored and start thinking, which happens quite often these days, the feeling of anger started to boil inside of me - why did this local government keep hiding the truth and even arresting the eight people who initially shared the information?\n",

      "Tweet: Comments The United States has seen its first case of person-to-person transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus in the spouse of an Illinois woman previously diagnosed with the disease, federal and state health officials said Thursday. The case, the sixth confirmed in this country, occurred in the husband of a woman who had traveled to China recently. The man, a Chicago resident who had close contact with his wife during the time she was symptomatic, had not gone to China, Illinois state health officials said. Meanwhile, the number of cases of the new disease, which causes fever and respiratory symptoms, continued to climb, according to the World Health Organization . Wuhan coronavirus: What to know There have been 7,818 cases confirmed globally, all but 82 of them in China. China has seen 170 deaths and 1,370 severe cases, while 18 countries other than China have had cases confirmed. Currently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is awaiting results on at least 92 potential cases of coronavirus, including results for a patient currently in isolation at Porter Regional Health . The woman, a resident of the city of Wuhan, was visiting the area when she fell ill. 'It could be just flu': Woman visiting Indiana from China being tested for coronavirus Support our journalism 'Immediate risk to the general public is low' CDC officials say the average American has little to fear. “Based on what we know now, our assessment remains that the immediate risk to the general public is low,” said Dr. Robert Redfield, CDC director, in a telephone news conference early Thursday afternoon. Illinois health workers are investigating 21 people who had close contact with the individuals who have already been diagnosed, said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health . Both of the ill individuals are in their 60s. Like his wife, the man has been hospitalized in isolation. The woman is improving, and the man, who has underlying health conditions, remains in stable condition, Illinois health officials said. The couple have not recently attended mass public gatherings. Still, CDC officials did not downplay the gravity of the situation. “This is a very serious public health situation,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “CDC and other partners are working to prevent community transmission from happening here.” At this time, however, she said the CDC did not recommend face masks for people in the general public. Instead, she urged people to follow basic steps to prevent disease such as the flu, such as washing hands and covering one’s cough.\n",

      "But simple surgical masks won't prevent wearers from being infected by the virus, which has infected thousands in China , killed over 200 people , and spread to 18 other countries including the U.S. If anything, those who are already infected should be wearing the masks.\n",

      "Dr. David Williams says initial testing in Ontario showed the woman was negative for the virus, but tests at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg came back as “weakly” positive.\n",
      "Officials say the woman had no symptoms when she returned to Canada, only left her home to go to hospital, and staff there wore protective gear.\n",

      "Tweet: Some silico-manganese producers in northern China may consider curtailing their alloy output in the coming weeks if they continue to be unable to transport ore from port to plant because of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, market sources have told Fastmarkets. Many alloy smelters have found it hard to locate vehicles that will deliver ore from ports to their own plants in the week ended Friday January 31. As part of the efforts to combat the spread of the coronavirus, many counties and villages have not been allowing trucks to travel through their regions, according to market sources. “The [road transportation restriction] measures are very strict,” an alloy smelter in China said. “We just could not find transport teams now, even though we want to buy more volumes [of ore].” Before the Chinese new year holiday began, scheduled for January 24-30, most alloy plants in China stocked sufficient volumes of ore to allow them to maintain their normal production rates until February 8-13. They planned to purchase additional volumes in the week beginning February 3, market participants said.\n",

      "Tweet: China coronavirus: World Health Organisation declares outbreak a global health emergency, reversing earlier decision The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global public health emergency over the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus on Thursday, citing the potential of the virus to spread to countries not prepared to deal with the contagion.\n",
      "Declaring the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasised multiple times during a press conference in Geneva that the move was not \"a vote of no confidence\" in China's ability to control the outbreak.\n",
      "\"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill prepared to deal with it,\" Tedros said. \"The vast majority of cases outside of China have a travel history to Wuhan or contact with someone with a travel history to Wuhan. We don't know what sort of damage this virus could do if it were to spread to a country with a weaker health system.\"\n",
      "Alongside his declaration of a global public health emergency, the WHO chief also outlined a number of recommendations to countries as they respond to the contagion's spread, including accelerating the development of a vaccine, reviewing preparedness plans, combating the spread of misinformation, and sharing data with the United Nations body.\n",
      "But WHO officials also warned that drastic restrictions in travel and trade were not necessary, and said they opposed any move to close borders with China or restrict Chinese travellers' access. Though they did not mention Russia by name, their remarks came soon after Moscow announced it was closing sections of the Russia-China border and suspending visas for Chinese visitors.\n",
      "\"Some countries have taken questionable measures concerning travellers,\" said Didier Houssin, chair of the WHO's emergency committee. Those measures, he said, \"should not constitute an example to follow\".\n",
      "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), left, and Professor Didier Houssin, Chair of Emergency Committee, right, talk to the media at the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva on Thursday.

Photo: AP\n",
      "With the declaration of a PHEIC, the WHO will have greater authority to question such actions, Houssin said: \"Why did you take this decision? What is the science supporting this decision? Could you reconsider this decision?\"\n",
      "Amid the outbreak, numerous governments are advising against all non-essential travel to China, while countries including the US and Japan have chartered flights to Wuhan to extract citizens living inside the locked-down metropolis. Several international air carriers have scaled back or suspended flights to the country amid dwindling demand.\n",
      "The WHO's announcement came amid rising criticism of the health agency's decision last week not to declare the outbreak a PHEIC, despite the rapidly rising number of cases inside China and the disease's steady spread overseas.\n",
      "To date, the Wuhan coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, has infected at least 8,100 people in mainland China and killed 171 people. Over 100 cases have been reported overseas, the vast majority of which were recent travellers to Hubei province.\n",
      "But of critical concern to health authorities is the small but rising number of human-to-human transmissions outside China, where a person with no recent travel to the country contracts the disease from another individual.\n",
      "The WHO alert \"makes sense given that we're seeing community transmission in other countries and because the illness is highly contagious,\" said Jennifer Huang Bouey, an epidemiologist and Tang Chair in China policy studies at Rand Corporation, a Washington-based think tank.\n",
      "The new coronavirus so far has a fatality rate that is lower than Sars and Mers, two contagions that spread globally in recent years, Huang Bouey pointed out.\n",
      "\"That means it's less dangerous for individuals but more dangerous for populations because there will be more people with mild symptoms who are still mobile and still traveling,\" she said.\n",
      "The United States announced its first human-to-human transmission case on Thursday shortly before the WHO's announcement, following the positive diagnosis of a Chicago resident who contracted the illness from his wife. Officials from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said the development was \"concerning\", but added that the immediate threat to the US public remained low.\n",
      "In another case confirmed earlier this week, a 33-year-old German man was infected with the disease by a colleague visiting from China. That colleague was reported to have shown no symptoms at the time of transmission.\n",
      "To date, there have been eight confirmed instances of human-to-human transmission outside of China, said Tedros. Beyond the US and Germany, such cases have also been confirmed in Vietnam and Japan.\n",
      "\"Although these numbers are still relatively small compared to the numbers of cases in China, we must all act together now to limit further spread,\" he said.\n",
      "The outbreak has led to Chinese authorities putting numerous cities, including Hubei's capital of Wuhan, under lockdown, shutting down major attractions and extending the Lunar New Year holiday. The government's response has elicited both praise \" most vocally from WHO officials \" and also criticism, particularly over a perception that regional officials initially downplayed the severity of the outbreak.\n",
      "The mayor of Wuhan offered to resign this week over the city's failure to disclose information in a \"timely manner\", while the top health official in Huanggang \" another Hubei city \" was fired on Thursday after a television appearance in which she could not answer basic questions about how many patients one of the city's hospitals was treating.\n",
      "Since the outbreak began, WHO officials have been consistently laudatory in their evaluation of China's response. During Thursday's press conference announcing the global public health emergency, Tedros, who recently returned from meetings with top Chinese officials in Beijing, spent more than six of his 14 minutes of remarks praising the Chinese government's actions.\n",
      "\"In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response,\" he said. \"And it's not an exaggeration.\"\n",

On Thursday, the World Health Organization declared it a global public health emergency. As the U.S. records its first confirmed person-to-person transmission, William Brangham talks to Dr. Anthony Fauci of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Read the Full Transcript\n",
      "And now, we return to the latest on the coronavirus outbreak.\n",
      "William Brangham has a closer look at today's developments.\n",
      "William Brangham:\n",
      "That's right, Judy.\n",
      "We have seen this past week the rapid spread of this virus within China, and its expansion now to at least 14 other nations.\n",
      "As we reported before, the World Health Organization has declared this a global health emergency. And we have now seen the first confirmed person-to-person transmission here in the U.S.\n",
      "For a closer look at what this all means, we turn to Dr. Anthony Fauci. He's the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH.\n",
      "Dr. Fauci, welcome back to the \"NewsHour.\"\n",
      "So, we have seen this first case. This apparently is a 60-something-year-old woman who went to China, got the virus, came home, and apparently infected her husband once she was back here.\n",
      "We know how viruses operate, especially among people who are living together. On some level, this is to be expected. For people who are seeing this news, though, what would you say to them for their alarm and their concern about this?\n",
      "Anthony Fauci:\n",
      "You know, I think you just said it. This is something to be expected.\n",
      "When you have someone who is in very close contact with another individual that is infected, it is not surprising that there's transmission.\n",
      "The thing that would be of concern and that we're watching very carefully is what you call sustained transmission, from one person to another to another to another.\n",
      "The system here right now is that that individual who was just recently infected from a person who actually was infected in China, came here, and then infected a close partner, that that individual is now under isolation, and the contacts with whom that person came into, those individuals are now being traced.\n",
      "So the public health system is now on top of that. What the concern globally is the rapid sustained person-to-person-to-person transmission, which is going on right now, certainly to a great degree in China.\n",
      "And the reason the WHO declared this a public health emergency of international concern is because, in other countries outside of China, we're starting to see that sustained transmission from person to person to person. That's the thing we need to be concerned about.\n",
      "But, right now, the risk in the United States is still low. But with the same breath I say that, I say we are taking this very, very seriously as public health officials and scientists.\n",
      "William Brangham:\n",
      "In your press conference earlier this week, you kept stressing the need for more information, for more data, for more samples to come out of China.\n",
      "Are you getting the cooperation and the information and the sharing you need from Chinese officials to best do your job?\n",
      "Anthony Fauci:\n",
      "You know, the answer is yes, but I think we can do better.\n",
      "If you compare the transparency during the SARS outbreak in 2002, everyone realized that they were egregiously non-transparent. And that delayed things for a long time.\n",
      "That's different now. They really are being open. But what we would like to see is the actual data and the patterns of disease that are going on there ourselves, because what happens there will inform us better as to what our policies will be here.\n",
      "So it looks like we're getting in that direction. The WHO is getting a group that is going to be put together to go there, hopefully including us, that would actually take a firsthand on-the-ground look at the data.\n",
      "William Brangham:\n",
      "There is a fair amount of modeling coming out of Hong Kong and other parts of the world looking at the current spread and indicating that this may turn into a real global pandemic.\n",
      "Do you believe that that's true, or do you still think it's too early to make that call?\n",
      "Anthony Fauci:\n",
      "No, I think you have to be realistic and say, it is possible that it could turn into a global pandemic.\n",
      "And that's the reason why we're doing everything we can to prevent that. I think to deny the possibility would be unrealistic. And that's the reason why we're preparing for the worst.\n",
      "Whether it's going to happen, we have no way of predicting what the odds of that are. The Chinese are doing rather dramatic things to try and contain that within their own country.\n",
      "The idea of locking down 50 million people to prevent them from going in and out of certain areas is a very, very dramatic way to try and contain that. What we're doing here is the typical, classical public health measures, trying the keep people who are infected out of the country, and then, if someone does get in, to isolate them and to prevent them from infecting others.\n",
      "Hopefully, those public health measures will work. But we still need to prepare for the worst. And we know we are taking this. And the public, the general public of the United States and the world should know that we are taking this very, very seriously.\n",
      "William Brangham:\n",
      "In just the short bit of time we have left, I imagine that this has got to be difficult for you, dealing with these fears about a handful of virus cases here in the U.S., when we have another virus, the influenza virus, that has already sickened millions of Americans, that's taken 8,000 people's lives here in this country alone.\n",
      "How do you help Americans balance those concerns and risks, over the fear of a virus coming here vs. the one we already have?\n",
      "Anthony Fauci:\n",
      "Well, I think to — I mean, we have been through this many times in so many other situations.\n",
      "The fear of the unknown and what might happen almost always supersedes the concern of something that actually is happening and causing a lot of damage.\n",
      "And you're absolutely correct. We are in the middle of a flu season, an we have more disease and death from flu than even — than some countries even have with this outbreak.\n",
      "So the issue is, we should concentrate on protecting ourselves from influenza, which we know its pattern, at the same time as we prepare for something that we're not familiar with, because it's a brand-new infection. It's a balance.\n",
      "William Brangham:\n",

      "I have been asked why I have not released my prophecies for 2020, and I have had to explain that I cannot share visions I have not received yet. Now, the visions have come and I am ready. For those of you who might be skeptical, I have a pretty decent track record as a Prophetess. My predictions over the past three years have been fairly accurate. Take a look at some of my predictions the year 2019:\n",
      "The 2019 elections will be mostly peaceful. I however see many people angry and agitated because of the small amounts of money available for campaigns. There will be no dollars or pounds in circulation. All candidates need to pray fervently against cancellation of election results, expensive court cases and treachery of close associates. Special fasts are important in order not to be at the right place at the wrong time. I see crowds of people covering their noses because of tear gas. Prayers are needed to avoid broken body parts and an international outcry about the authenticity of the elections. I also see sellers of brooms and umbrellas doing brisk business.\n",
      "This year will be a bad one for predators who ruin the lives of women and children. I see crowds of women and men around the country taking laws into their hands. We all need to pray against jungle justice, but my visions reveal a lack of sympathy for confirmed rapists and molesters.\n",
      "In 2019, I see a lot of drama, fighting, rumours, attacks and counter attacks on social media. Things might get very nasty. All public officers, celebrities and influencers beware. Loading...\n",
      "There will be a global meltdown involving Game of Thrones fans.\n",
      "In 2019, the final season of Game of Thrones will be aired. For six weeks this year, millions of Game of Thrones fans will engage in all sorts of crazy behavior. They will scream, rave, rant, laugh, cry and attempt to throw things at the TV screen. Verily, Verily I say unto you, beware if you have a Game of Thrones fan as a husband, wife, brother, sister, roommate, colleague, friend or child. They will need your help during this period.\n",
      "As I predicted, the 2019 elections were mostly peaceful. Many politicians found the elections underwhelming because of the lack of money available to slosh around. And the sellers of umbrellas and brooms did do brisk business. Last year was a bad one for sexual predators. Not only did Ekiti State start implementing their Sex Offenders Register by introducing a Name and Shame policy, the BBC released a documentary about ‘Sex for Grades’, exposing the antics of lecherous University lecturers. A famous man of God got called out for sexual abuse, opening a serious can of worms, and a school supervisor in Lagos got 60 years in jail for defiling a two year old girl. Sadly, many predators got away but there are indications that it will no longer be business as usual as there is a growing consensus that the culture of silence around sexual violence is coming to an end. As for my Game of Thrones prediction, I was absolutely right, there was a global meltdown, especially after Daenerys Targaryen went from saviour of the people to mass murderer in just two minutes.\n",
      "Now that I have established that I am a true prophet and not one of the deceivers who abound all over the place, here are my prophecies for 2020.\n",
      "1. This Year Will Be A Difficult One For China\n",
      "The year 2020 has not started well for China and it is going to take time for them to recover from the Coronavirus disaster. I predict that the virus will be contained after many deaths and infections but China will pay a stiff price. The Chinese economy will be hit on many fronts. Clients around the world will cancel massive orders for Chinese products. Thousands of business people and tourists will cancel trips to China. There might even be xenophobic attacks on Chinatowns around the world. Many roads and facilities under construction across Africa will not have the usual Chinese labour to deliver projects on time. I however see a silver lining in all this. China will bounce back stronger than ever. African leaders will learn it is possible to build a 1,000 bed hospital in ten days and not ten years. And it is better for our children to be in school learning mathematics and science in order to figure out the science of tomorrow instead of roaming the streets selling bread and oranges because we lack the political will and resources to keep them in school.\n",

I also predict the arrival of new animals such as the Lion, Elephant, Tiger, and so on in other regions of the country. There might be debates about the translation of these names in local languages, but that will be a small matter. By the end of 2020, our security architecture will be greatly enhanced by the addition of these creatures great and small.\n",
      "3. I see many Mothers-in-Law struggling to prevent ‘Megxits’.\n",
      "Already, I have ministered to three mothers who are afraid that their daughters-in-law might take their sons far away from them. In my visions, I saw one son being dragged to Kano from Lagos (Mariamxit) one from Port Harcourt to Kampala, Uganda (Carolxit) and I saw one all the way in Australia (Bukkyxit) though I told the mother I saw London in my visions. If you have suspicions that a ‘Megxit’ is looming over your family, I advise the following steps: One month of fasting, donations to five orphanages, purchase of ten Dutch Wax wrappers for your daughter-in-law and a gold jewelry set, and an announcement that this year, you will be too busy to visit anyone because you will be preoccupied with business interests and religious retreats. Trust me, the spirit of ‘Megxit’ will quickly depart from your environs. May ‘Megxit’ never be your portion.\n",
      "4. There Will Be More Sex Scandals In 2020\n",
      "How can we get through 2020 without a juicy sex scandal? Last year churches and tertiary institutions were under scrutiny. It has been revealed to me that this year, we will hear about what truly goes on in hospitals. Doctors preying on Nurses. Doctors taking advantage of Patients. Nurses abusing patients and ‘Kobalising’ Doctors. This is just the tip of the iceberg o! There will be drama in some top banks. In my visions I see big men and women, private jets, lots of naira, euro and dollars lying on tables, bottles of expensive champagne, lots of fine leather and endless quantities of food. I am not sure what all these things mean. However, I urge all big men and women in the banking industry to be very prayerful, and to be very careful with their cellphones. If you are in this sector and would like to know more, I can arrange a bespoke prophecy for you. I also predict Baby Mama and Baby Daddy drama this year. I keep seeing images of a particular celebrity taking photographs with a football team, I am not certain how to interpret this. I can only advise that he start using umbrellas before he goes out into the rain.\n",
      "5. This Will Be A Year Of Grand Celebrations\n",
      "I see many great celebrations this year. I see the passing away of very old and distinguished citizens. There will be public outpourings of praise from lifelong friends and enemies alike. There will be parties which will last for days in their honour. I see many weddings, where the couple getting married only know twenty out of the 500 guests present – the rest are only know to their parents, who only really know 300 of the guests – the rest just found their way there. I see many decorators, caterers, and musicians smiling all the way to the bank, and I see a popular MC who might be booed because he repeats the same jokes at every gig.\n",
      "On the whole, 2020 will hopefully be a year when citizens read more newspapers, read interesting books, listen to the radio, watch good television programs and visit informative websites. I predict that if people are better informed, they will be able to analyse current events and trends for themselves. This is however a prediction that I do not want to see come to pass. How else would I make a living if I can’t prey on ignorant, lazy-minded and gullible people? Remember, if you need my services you can pay in any currency of your choice, my ministry has accounts in Naira, Dollars, Pounds and Euro. Have a blessed year. - AdPone -\n",

      "Respawn Entertainment Popular battle royale game Apex Legends will celebrate its first anniversary with the start of a new season. Developer Respawn Entertainment is ramping up anticipation for season 4 by adding big twists to the game's storyline before the new season even kicks off.\n",
      "Apex Legends season 4, dubbed Assimilation, will add a new character, changes to the ranking systems, map adjustments and more. We also got a pretty surprising introduction to the newest Legend in the game.\n",
      "Apex Legends is free to play on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Here's what we know so far about season 4.\n",
      "When does Apex Legends season 4 start? Season 4 will begin on Feb. 4. The date also marks the one-year anniversary of the game.\n",
      "Who are the new characters in season 4? Respawn Entertainment did something interesting prior to the start of the new season of Apex Legends, which takes place in the same universe as EA's Titanfall games. It introduced a new character to the game, then killed them off before the season even started.\n",

      "Following the surprise twist, multiple tweets from the Apex Legends Twitter focused on reports from Hammond Robotics, a tech company in the Titanfall universe. The company reported multiple break-ins as well as employees not showing up for work . One of the tweets showed security footage of an intruder, who happens to look like Revenant.\n",

      "— Apex Legends (@PlayApex) January 29, 2020 On Thursday, the official trailer for Revenant debuted and provided more backstory to the mysterious character. It also revealed a possible new character for Apex Legends season 5.\n",
      "The video description says, \"Revenant used to be human. He was the greatest hitman the Mercenary Syndicate ever had. But when his programming eventually failed, he saw what Hammond Robotics had turned him into: a walking nightmare of steel and vestigial flesh.\"\n",
      "The events in the trailer take place 25 years before Apex Legends and five years after Titanfall 2. Revenant is sent to kill a con-man named Marcos Andrade. After he completes his contract by taking out Marcos, his wife and security guards, Revenant realizes that he's actually a Simulacrum -- an android with a human brain. He looks at his hand and sees Hammond Robotics. This could explain his attack years later and Forge, who was backed by the company.\n",
      "At the end of the trailer, we see Marcos' daughter crying over the dead body of her father, eyes filled with rage. The little girl might actually be a new Legend. Her father mentions her name, Loba, and gives her a wolf figurine early in the video.\n",
      "In August, a data miner found info about a character named Rosie that also goes by Loba. This could mean she will be introduced in season 5.\n",

      "Apex Legends season 3 introduced a new map called World's Edge. It replaced the previous map, Kings Canyon, which was partially destroyed thanks to the last Legend added to the roster, Crypto. Season 4 will have players starting at World's Edge, but then switching to Kings Canyon. The reason for the switch hasn't been revealed yet.\n",
      "There will also be a change to the Apex Legends ranking system. Players climb the tiers throughout the season based on their performance. The very top -- known as the Apex Predator rank -- is now limited to the top 500 players in the world. The new season will be split into two ranking seasons, likely when the switch from World's Edge to Kings Canyon happens.\n",
      "Respawn will also introduce a new weapon for players called the Sentinel. It's a bolt-action sniper rifle that can decimate an opponent's armor.\n",

      "Tweet:  10:45 AM CST Jan 31, 2020 Scottie Andrew, CNN The novel coronavirus that's sickening thousands globally — and at least five people in the U.S. — is inspiring countries to close their borders and Americans to buy up surgical masks quicker than major retailers can restock them.There's another virus that has infected 15 million Americans across the country and killed more than 8,200 people this season alone. It's not a new pandemic: It's influenza.The 2019-2020 flu season is projected to be one of the worst in a decade, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At least 140,000 people have been hospitalized with complications from the flu, and that number is predicted to climb as flu activity swirls.The flu is a constant in Americans' lives. It's that familiarity that makes it more dangerous to underestimate, said Dr. Margot Savoy, chair of family and community medicine at Temple University's Lewis Katz School of Medicine.\"Lumping all the viral illness we tend to catch in the winter sometimes makes us too comfortable thinking everything is 'just a bad cold,'\" she said. \"We underestimate how deadly influenza really is.\"Even the low-end estimate of deaths each year is startling, Savoy said: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts at least 12,000 people will die of the flu in the U.S. every year. In the 2017-2018 flu season, as many as 61,000 people died and 45 million were sickened.In the 2019-2020 season so far, 15 million people in the U.S. have gotten the flu and 8,200 people have died of it, including at least 54 children. Flu activity has been elevated for 11 weeks straight, the CDC reported, and will likely continue for the next several weeks.Savoy, who also serves on the American Academy of Family Physician's board of directors, said the novelty of emerging infections can overshadow the flu. People are less panicked about the flu because healthcare providers \"appear to have control\" over the infection.\"We fear the unknown and we crave information about new and emerging infections,\" she said. \"We can't quickly tell what is truly a threat and what isn't, so we begin to panic — often when we don't need to.\"The flu can be fatalDr. Nathan Chomilo, an adjunct assistant professor of pediatrics at University of Minnesota Medical School, said that the commonness of the flu often underplays its severity, but people should take it seriously.\"Severe cases of the flu are not mild illnesses,\" Chomilo said. \"Getting the actual flu, you are miserable.\"The flu becomes dangerous when secondary infections emerge, the result of an already-weakened immune system. Bacterial and viral infections compound the flu's symptoms. People with chronic illnesses are also at a heightened risk for flu complications.Those complications include pneumonia, inflammation in the heart and brain and organ failure, which, in some cases, can be fatal.Chomilo, an internist and pediatrician for Park Nicollet Health Services, said this flu season has been one of the worst his Minnesota practice has seen since the H1N1 virus outbreak in 2009. Some of his patients, healthy adults in their 30s, have been sent to the intensive care unit, relying on ventilators, due to flu complications.The virus is always changingInfluenza is tricky because the virus changes every year. Sometimes, the dominant strain in a flu season will be more virulent than in previous years, which can impact the number of people infected and the severity of their symptoms.Most of these changes in the virus are small and insignificant, a process called antigenic drift. That year's flu vaccine is mostly effective in protecting patients in spite of these small changes, said Melissa Nolan, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina's School of Public Health.Occasionally, the flu undergoes a rare antigenic shift, which results when a completely new strain of virus emerges that human bodies haven't experienced before, she said.Savoy compares it to a block party: The body thinks it knows who — or in this case, which virus — will show up, and therefore, which virus it needs to keep out. But if a virus shows up in a completely new getup, it becomes difficult for the body's \"bouncers\" — that's the immune system — to know who to look for and keep out. The stealthy virus can infiltrate easily when the body doesn't recognize it.This flu season, there's no sign of antigenic shift, the most extreme change. But it's happened before, most recently in 2009 with the H1N1 virus. It became a pandemic because people had no immunity against it, the CDC reported.Get your flu shot, experts sayTo avoid complications from the flu, Savoy, Chomilo and Nolan have the same recommendation: Get vaccinated.It's not easy to tell how flu vaccination rates impact the number of people infected, but Savoy said it seems that the years she struggles to get her patients vaccinated are the years when more patients end up hospitalized with the flu, even if the total number of infections doesn't budge.The CDC reported at least 173 million flu vaccine doses have been administered this flu season so far. That's about 4 million more doses than the manufacturers who make the vaccines projected to provide this season.Still, there are some who decide skipping the vaccine is worth the risk. A 2017 study found that people decline the flu vaccine because they don't think it's effective or they're worried it's unsafe, even though CDC research shows the vaccine effectively reduces the risk of flu in up to 60% of the population.Chomilo said some of his most frustrating cases of the flu are in patients who can't be vaccinated because of preexisting conditions or their age (children under 6 months old can't be vaccinated).There are two important reasons to get the flu vaccine, he said, which are \"protecting yourself and being a good community member.\" CNN —\n",

      "This new strain of the virus has been named “2019 novel Coronavirus.” And it’s already claimed over 170 lives with the WHO declaring the outbreak as a global emergency. The number of cases has jumped to more than 8100 globally surpassing the number of people diagnosed with SARS. So what are the symptoms?\n",
      "It’s a severe respiratory illness so symptoms include fever, flu-like symptoms such as coughing, sore throat and headaches, as well as difficulty breathing. It normally starts with a fever, moves to a dry cough which then leads to shortness of breath that may involve hospitalisation.\n",
      "Chinese authorities have said the virus is able to spread through touching and contact during its incubation period of one to 14 days and before any symptoms appeared.\n",
      "At present there is no cure or vaccine. An expert at China's National Health Commission (NHC) said one week was sufficient for a recovery from mild coronavirus symptoms. About one in four cases are meant to be severe.\n",
      "Most of the deaths have been of elderly people or those with pre-existing respiratory problems. Where did it come from?\n",
      "The source of the outbreak is still under investigation in Wuhan City. Preliminary investigations have identified environmental samples positive in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan City.\n",
      "Now once this animal reservoir (where the virus lives) is detected, then the problem becomes much easier to deal with.\n",
      "While some sea-going mammals can carry coronaviruses, experts have indicated that the Seafood Market also has live wild animals, including chickens, bats, rabbits and snakes, which are more likely to be the source. Some reports have said the virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife.\n",
      "According to the BBC , researchers say the new virus is closely related to one found in Chinese horseshoe bats. But this is yet to be verified, and even if it’s come from a bat, it could have been passed to humans through another animal.

      "Need proof? According to the chinese National Health Commission, the number of confirmed cases increased from 2,835 on Monday this week to 5000 on Tuesday. That's 60% overnight. The youngest confirmed case is a nine-month-old girl in Beijing.\n",
      "The numbers, however, could be significantly higher due to media censorship in China, some people being asymptomatic, meaning they are contagious without symptoms, and the lack of testing kits available.\n",
      "Professor Neil Ferguson , a public health expert at Imperial College, London, told the Guardian his “best guess” put the number at 100,000 infected.\n",
      "At this point, it has spread to Thailand, Hong Kong, the United States, Taiwan, Macau, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, France, Canada, Vietnam, Nepal, Cambodia and Germany. At the time of reporting there are nine cases in Australia and there have been no deaths outside China. How is it diagnosed?\n",
      "Those infected are diagnosed via swabs from the throat or fluid from the lungs. Scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the disease, which will enable scientists to develop a test to identify people who might be infected, even before they show any symptoms. It will hopefully also lead to a vaccine. A woman who works for a pharmaceutical company said she wears the mask out of concern for the coronavirus. \"I'd wear a mask if I were you,\" she said.

      "Tweet: Playtime childrenswear show to refocus on Paris, New York, Shanghai editions By aA+ aA- Childrenswear trade show organiser Picaflor is able to cater to a huge number of buyers from all around the world with the Playtime shows in Paris, New York and Shanghai. Enough of a reach to convince Picaflor to decide to stop holding Playtime in Las Vegas and Tokyo. Picaflor, organiser of the Playtime childrenswear shows, is terminating the Las Vegas and Tokyo editions - Iloveplaytime The Kid’s Hub Las Vegas by Playtime show was introduced in February 2019, aiming to feature a slightly less upmarket range of exhibitors than Playtime New York, its main target demographic being Midwestern buyers. The show failed to win over a large audience and, after two sessions, in February and August 2019, Picaflor has decided to put a stop to it. “We staged two good editions, but the show was losing ground all the same. We will now focus on New York, while the Las Vegas event has nevertheless enabled us to connect with new buyers,” said Sébastien de Hutten, director of the Playtime shows.The Playtime Tokyo show, which was launched 10 years ago, has also been terminated, its last edition being the one held from July 31 to August 2 2019. Two years ago, the Tokyo event had been revamped to better respond to the expectations of the Japanese market. The latter is a complicated market, due to the country’s low birth rate and the weakening Japanese economy. Also, 97% of the show's visitors came from Japan, proof that the event didn’t have a wider regional reach. Partly because of this, in July 2019 Picaflor launched the Playtime Shanghai show. “Even though visitors to Playtime Shanghai are predominantly from China, it is a more international event. Its initial editions attracted visitors also from Japan, as well as Singapore and Korea,” said de Hutten. The next edition of Playtime Shanghai is scheduled on February 19 and 20, provided of course that flying to China, a country that is currently off-limits due to the coronavirus outbreak, will be possible again. Advertisements fiber_manual_record fiber_manual_record Picaflor has already proved that it is more than willing to test its capabilities in new markets. In July 2017, it launched Playtime Berlin. However, the show was halted after three editions, due to a declining number of visitors. “We are always trying out new formats to respond to the needs of our exhibitors and, in any case, this enables us to reach new buyers,” said de Hutten, who underlined how Playtime New York attracts buyers from the American continent, Playtime Shanghai from the whole of Asia and Playtime Paris from the world over. The most recent edition of Playtime Paris was held from January 25 to 27 2020. The organisers have not yet published attendance figures, though at the end of the event they were encouraged by the fact that the transport strikes plaguing the French capital only had a limited impact.

The United States warned Americans not to travel to China as the death toll from the new virus reached 213 and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency. A growing number of airlines are suspending flights to China to halt the spread of the virus, stoking fears of a blow to global economic growth and boosting safe-haven government bonds. \"The length of the flight suspensions to China by global carriers, some stretching into March, gives an idea of the expected period of economic disruption. This does not mean that market focus will be on the epidemic for this long,\" ING strategists said in a client note. \"A slowdown in the rate of confirmed cases would be greeted with relief. This relief would not necessarily entail a return to interest rates levels prevailing at the start of the year however,\" they added. Most 10-year bond yields were unchanged on the day, with Germany's 10-year yield at -0.40%, near three-month lows hit on Thursday. Investor attention will turn to \"flash\" or first estimate euro zone inflation and GDP numbers due at 1000 GMT. The inflation figure is expected to rise to 1.4% from 1.3% last month, while GDP growth is expected to slow to 1.1% from 1.2%, according to a Reuters poll. A pick-up in inflation numbers since November - alongside healthier business activity surveys - has stoked some optimism that the worst may be over for the euro zone economy. The releases follow an unexpected contraction in French economic growth during the fourth quarter, as manufacturing output slumped in the face of strikes over an unpopular pension reform and German inflation numbers, which came in slightly lower than expected.

      "The new coronavirus is already one of the worst infections of our lifetime. Let us hope and pray the massive containment effort is effective. Most of China is on lock down this week and next, with preparations underway in case six more weeks are required.\n",
      "One of the least significant problems of the virus is the effect on our industry. The iPhone and nearly all other phones (except Samsung) are mostly produced in China. Two weeks of production and store closings can be recovered. Six weeks more is could have a severe impact.\n",
      "Skyworks, which supplies radio frequency parts to nearly every phone manufacturer , just said To date, we've seen no material impact in our supply chain or with demand signals. However, the situation is evolving. So we've reflected some added risk, as I mentioned, to our March guide, including, as you'll notice, a wider range of outcomes. So to your question, likewise, we're thinking about potential effects into the June quarter. And even though our channels are lean, we are concerned about how this plays out because we just don't know. (Emphasis added.)\n",

      "Tweet: Just as the outlook for the global economy had been brightening in recent months, a new threat has suddenly emerged in the form of the viral outbreak in China.\n",
      "That was the cautionary message that Chairman Jerome Powell delivered Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates low after its latest policy meeting.\n",
      "Speaking at a news conference, Powell said the signing of a preliminary U.S.-China trade deal earlier this month, the resolution of Brexit and continuing low interest rates in the United States and abroad had suggested that the world economy would start to expand more quickly after being held back by trade conflicts. That scenario is now complicated by the emergence of the virus.\n",
      "Still, Powell noted that the extent of the economic damage that the virus may ultimately inflict, in China or around the world, remains unknown.\n",
      "“There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and globally,” Powell said. “It’s very uncertain how far it will spread and what the (economic) effects will be in China, for its trading partners, and around the world…. We are very carefully monitoring the situation.”\n",
      "Even so, Powell said he thinks there are “there are signs and reasons to expect” a global economic rebound. And he said the initial U.S.-China trade agreement and a new trade pact among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday could potentially boost the U.S. economy.\n",
      "Powell spoke after the Fed had announced that it has kept its key interest rate unchanged in a low range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent, far below levels that were typical during previous expansions. The chairman and other Fed officials have indicated that they see that range as low enough to support faster growth and hiring.\n",
      "Investors, however, are increasingly betting that the Fed will feel compelled to cut rates later this year, likely out of concern that the U.S. will feel the impact of a global slowdown stemming from the coronavirus. The chances of a cut by September’s Fed meeting have risen above 70 per cent, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s FedWatch tool, up from roughly 40 per cent just a month ago.\n",
      "Still, Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said he saw nothing in the Fed’s statement or at Powell’s news conference to make him change his belief that the central bank will keep its benchmark rate unchanged for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "“Unless the U.S. experiences its own epidemic, we doubt that the indirect effects from the disruptions in China would be enough to warrant a U.S. rate cut,” Ashworth said.\n",
      "The coronavirus has in effect shut down much of that nation and seems sure to slow the Chinese economy — the world’s second-largest — which had already been decelerating. The virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.\n",
      "Major companies across the world have responded to the virus by suspending some operations in China. Starbucks said it plans to close half its stores in China, its second-largest market. British Airways has halted all flights to China, and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing.\n",
      "Hotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the industries that have suffered the most immediate repercussions. Apple’s chief executive officer Tim Cook said the company’s suppliers in China have been forced to delay the re-opening of factories that have closed for the Chinese New Year holiday until Feb. 10.\n",
      "Stock prices slipped after the Fed issued its statement and Powell concluded his news conference. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed barely higher after having posted stronger gains in earlier trading. Bond yields declined slightly.\n",
      "The Fed’s statement, which its policymaking committee approved 10-0, was nearly identical to the one it issued in December, though this time it described consumer spending as rising at only a “moderate” rather than at a “strong” pace. That change likely reflects relatively modest spending by Americans over the holiday shopping season.\n",
      "The statement also signalled that the Fed wants inflation to move higher. The Fed’s preferred measure showed inflation rose just 1.5 per cent in November from a year earlier, below its two per cent target.\n",
      "“We’re not comfortable with inflation running persistently below” the Fed’s objective, Powell said. The Fed seeks inflation at that level as a cushion against deflation, a destabilizing drop in prices and wages.\n",
      "Last year, the Fed cut its benchmark rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018. Powell and other Fed officials credit those rate cuts with revitalizing the housing market, which had stumbled early last year, and offsetting some of the drag from President Donald Trump’s trade war with China.\n",
      "On another topic, Powell said the Fed will continue its purchases of six-month Treasury bills to ensure that short-term lending markets operate smoothly. The Fed began buying $60 billion of the bills each month in October to expand cash reserves that are available for overnight lending, after a shortage of reserves caused overnight rates to spike. The lending squeeze also pushed the Fed’s benchmark rate out of its target range.\n",
      "The Fed plans to continue its purchases until the second quarter, Powell said, while it slowly draws down some temporary lending it has also done to boost short-term lending markets.\n",
      "Powell said the overall economy, not just Wall Street, has benefited from the Fed’s bond-buying because it’s enabled the Fed’s low-rate policy to reduce mortgage rates and other consumer borrowing costs.\n",
      "“That really is important for the public,” Powell said.\n",
      "The Fed’s decision came a day after Trump, in a tweet, again pressed Powell to cut rates, arguing that this would make U.S. interest rates “competitive with other Countries.” Yet the Fed hopes to avoid the ultra-low and negative interest rates that exist in much of Europe and in Japan, which they, and most analysts, see as evidence of weak economies. \n",

      "The yen was steady at 109.06 per dollar and the greenback a tad stronger at $1.1023 per euro on Friday.\n",

      "In Thailand - heavily exposed to Chinese tourism - the baht, which has stubbornly resisted months of jawboning and policy easing from the central bank, has shed 4 per cent for the month.\n",
      "Investors are waiting for details about the virus itself, and for signs of a slowdown in its spread in order to judge its likely human and economic costs.\n",
      "In the absence of that information, many are looking to the experience of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003 for guidance.\n",
      "This time, however, the number of cases has already exceeded the 8,000 logged during the SARS crisis, the official response has been far more drastic and China's share of the world's economy is four times larger.\n",
      "Some 60 million people in the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province, are living under virtual lockdown. Several global airlines have stopped flying to mainland China and economists are slashing their forecasts for Chinese growth.\n",
      "“We think the impact will be particularly frontloaded and likely larger than that of the SARS outbreak,” BNP Paribas economists said in a note warning that the current quarter's year-on-year growth figure in China could come in below 5 per cent.\n",
      "“We do not know exactly how the situation will evolve over the coming days, weeks and months and therefore what the duration of the shock will be.\n",
      "“The risks appear skewed to the downside, with scope for potentially harmful mutations of the virus due to a large (and rising) number of infected individuals.”\n",

      "Tweet: The US dollar continues to show signs of life against the Japanese yen as although we did pullback during the trading session, we have also turned around. After all, the stock markets opened up rather brutally during the trading session, but it should be rather interesting to note that the Japanese yen has lost some of its strength against the greenback. Ultimately, it looks as if we are getting close to turning around again, but there is a major uptrend line underneath that would also offer support even if we do fall from here.\n",
      "USD/JPY Video 31.01.20 Breaking above the 50 day EMA which is colored in red on the chart would be a sign that we are going back towards the ¥110 level, and therefore continuing the longer-term trend. Ultimately, if we can break above the ¥110 level, the market is likely to go looking towards the ¥111 level. All things being equal, this market continues to find reasons to go higher so with that being the case you can’t fight it. Granted, this pair does move with risk appetite but paying attention to the stock markets would be the first thing that you can do.\n",
      "There are a lot of concerns about the coronavirus, but quite frankly there is the possibility that the US dollar strengthens due to the treasury markets anyway. In other words, there are a lot of crosscurrents here, but I think at this point as long as we can stay above the uptrend line and the 200 day EMA, we probably will continue to find reasons to go higher. The Japanese yen is typically a safety currency, but it has not been functioning as strongly as it typically does lately, so that something worth noting as well.

      "Tweet: Investors are in for what could be a volatile year for crude oil prices, with a trio of catalysts tugging in different directions on demand for the energy source.\n",
      "These three drivers include the Wuhan coronavirus, OPEC+ output adjustments and mounting outcry against the use of fossil fuels for their role in contributing to climate change, according to Regina Mayor, KPMG global head of energy.\n",
      "Coronavirus The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak has been the most visible driver of crude prices as of late, sending prices tanking as concerns that the China-originated disease will impact purchases from the world’s largest oil demand center.\n",
      "As the number of confirmed cases and fatalities from the coronavirus climbed, West Texas intermediate crude oil prices ( CL=F ) fell nearly 15% in the just month-long year-to-date.\n",
      "“It is pretty troubling because we’ve seen a $10 per barrel drop, 15%, in just a few weeks, largely due to concerns about demand, even though the demand destruction right now is estimated about 300-500k barrels per day, which is a tiny blip in the total 110 million barrels per day that we use,” Mayor told Yahoo Finance’s On the Move Thursday.\n",
      "“What concerns me is the trajectory of this virus,” she added. “I don’t think we’ve seen the actual demand destruction that will ultimately take place with the reduction in consumer and business activity with all the things that you’ve mentioned with how the virus is spreading.”\n",
      "A heat map shows where the virus has infected citizens, and the toll. 更多 Plus, markets tend to overemphasize downside demand destruction risks and underestimate supply side destruction risks when it comes to pricing oil, leading to a typical downward bias in prices, Mayor said. That’s been the case in other recent events of geopolitical shocks like the Iran crisis earlier this month, when the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general immediately sent prices spiking higher before rhetoric downplaying fears of a full-blown military conflict sent oil prices sinking lower.\n",
      "“We’ve seen the $5 per barrel decline even before the virus was announced,” Mayor said. “And since then, we’ve seen an even more precipitous decline.”\n",
      "Amid the virus, Mayor believes oil prices could fall to a low $50-per barrel range for West Texas intermediate crude and a mid-$50 range for the global benchmark Brent ( BZ=F ), before recovering.\n",

      "The implication is that the group would use the earlier convention to deepen a supply cut of 1.7 million barrels per day it had agreed back in December to enforce.

      "Tweet: Amazon.com Inc on Thursday posted holiday quarter results well above expectations as the expansion of its one-day shipping program came under budget and membership in its Prime loyalty club notched a 50% rise in two years. Shares soared as much as 13% in after-hours trade, putting the online retailer back in the $1 trillion (761 billion pounds) market capitalisation club. If the share gain holds on Friday, it will be the biggest daily jump for Amazon since October 2017.\n",
      "Amazon also forecast operating income of up to $4.2 billion in the current quarter, down from $4.4 billion the year prior. Still, that appeared to assuage investor concerns about Amazon's continued spending on fast delivery, which could have erased windfalls from e-commerce, advertising and cloud computing sales.\n",
      "\"We’re past the worst in terms of the margin pressure from the one-day shipping initiative,\" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. That and the \"massively overstated\" concerns about cloud competition rebutted some of the biggest arguments against buying the stock, he said.\n",
      "Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters that additional investment in one-day shipping came slightly under the $1.5 billion the company had forecast for the fourth quarter, despite more customer orders. Extra costs in the current period will be about $1 billion for the delivery effort, he said.\n",
      "Olsavsky added that spending on video would rise going forward, but the company was still determining its overall level of investment for 2020.\n",
      "Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said in a statement that the world's biggest online retailer now has more than 150 million paid members in its loyalty club Prime, a 50% increase from its last disclosure in April 2018.\n",
      "Subscribers keep returning to Amazon to benefit from perks like fast delivery, television and music streaming. Its suite of voice-controlled Echo speakers has prompted still more engagement from customers, and grocery orders more than doubled in the holiday quarter in a vote of confidence for Amazon's 2017 bet to buy Whole Foods Market.\n",
      "This formula has helped make Bezos the richest person in the world.\n",
      "Amazon is hoping that cutting delivery times to one day for Prime members will let it outmanoeuvre rivals such as Walmart Inc that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees. The company made progress in the holiday season, reporting that it quadrupled one-day and same-day deliveries over the year-ago quarter.\n",
      "Revenue from subscription fees grew 32% to $5.2 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, as more shoppers signed up for Prime than in any period prior.\n",
      "WATCHING CORONAVIRUS\n",
      "Net sales rose 21% to $87.4 billion while net income rose 8% to $3.3 billion - each over $1 billion more than analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n",
      "The profit rise reflects the evolving nature of Amazon's business. The company has been moving away from low-margin retail toward a marketplace model where it takes lucrative fees for shipping and advertising the products of other merchants on its platform.\n",
      "This has helped weather massive spending at Amazon, a company that has long passed up short-term results in favour of bets that could reap it future profit.\n",
      "For instance, faster delivery has meant a surge in hiring and related costs. The company said its full-time and part-time headcount rose 23% to 798,000 in the quarter, as it expanded both fulfilment and corporate software roles.\n",
      "Expenses similarly grew as the company moved inventory closer to customers and built out its last-mile delivery network, which now handles the biggest share of Amazon-ordered packages in the United States. Amazon said worldwide shipping costs rose 43% to $12.9 billion.\n",
      "Amazon Web Services (AWS) also has seen infrastructure and marketing costs rise. The unit responsible for selling data storage and computing power in the cloud lost out to Microsoft Corp in a high-profile deal last quarter to sell technology to the U.S. Department of Defense, in what could have netted the company $10 billion over a decade. Amazon is contesting the contract decision.\n",
      "Microsoft on Wednesday reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales for its Azure cloud computing service. Yet Amazon posted better results than feared, growing revenue 34% to $9.95 billion, similar to its third-quarter increase.\n",

Others say “bless you,” but I always wondered if I should say that if I’m not religious. I asked a Chinese friend if he says anything when people sneeze and he told me that when he was younger his parents would say, “ yībǎi suì ” on the first sneeze and “ liǎngbǎi suì ” on the second.

Let’s hope you don’t have any of these (especially just now), but if you do then you may want to visit a local クリニック ( kurinikku , clinic) or 病院 ( byōin , hospital), and call 119 for a 救急車 ( kyūkyūsha , ambulance) if necessary.\n",
      "After arriving at a 病院, look for the section marked 内科 ( naika , internal medicine). The other option, 外科 ( geka , surgery), deals with broken legs and that kind of thing. Once you’ve been assigned an 医者 or 看護師 ( kangoshi , nurse), you as the 患者 ( kanja , patient) will be asked about your 症状 in detail.\n",
      "It helps to look up some vocabulary in advance if you can. You can tell the doctor that particular body parts hurt, for example: 喉が痛い ( nodo ga itai , my throat hurts) or 頭が痛い ( atama ga itai , my head hurts). If you don’t know the word for the body part that hurts, though, it may be best to just point somewhere on your body and say ここが痛い ( koko ga itai , here’s where it hurts). Adverbs like 少し ( sukoshi , a little) and とても ( totemo , very) will also help the doctor in their 診断 ( shindan , diagnosis): 昨日から咳がでて、喉がとても痛いです ( Kinō kara seki ga dete, nodo ga totemo itai desu , I’ve been coughing since yesterday and my throat really hurts).\n",
      "Once the doctor has reached their 診断, you may or may not need a 処方せん ( shohōsen , prescription) to take to a 薬局. It could be that you may not need any medicine, in which case the doctor may advise you to うがい、手洗いを徹底してください ( ugai, tearai o tettei shite kudasai , please gargle and wash your hands thoroughly). They may also recommend that 十分な睡眠と栄養で体調を整えることが大切 ( jūbunna suimin to eiyō de taichō o totonoeru koto ga taisetsu , it is important to get enough sleep and sufficient nourishment to keep yourself in good condition) so that you don’t get even sicker.\n",

      "Tweet: First case of coronavirus in US: Patient got pneumonia, but now only has cough, study says Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY Reblog A 35-year-old Seattle-area man identified as the nation's first person with coronavirus developed pneumonia while in the hospital but has improved after getting antiviral medication, according to a new study. A report published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine said the Snohomish County, Washington, man remained in the hospital as of Thursday and has no symptoms other than a cough that is improving. The study, which describes the man's symptoms and treatment but does not identify him, provides the most detailed look among the six reported cases of coronavirus in the U.S . On Thursday, the CDC and Illinois state health officials reported the first U.S. case of person-to-person spread of the illness – the husband of a Chicago woman who developed symptoms after visiting China. Public health officials warn that there are likely to be more U.S. cases, including the possibility of limited person-to-person spread of the respiratory virus, but they emphasized the risk to the public remains low. The outbreak has infected nearly 10,000 people, mostly in China, and killed more than 200 there. Tips: How to stay healthy on a plane as coronavirus, flu, colds raise travel concerns The Washington state man traveled to Wuhan, China, to visit family. He told health officials that he did not visit the seafood market linked to a cluster of initial cases nor did he visit any health centers or come into contact with anyone with symptoms of the respiratory virus. He returned home Jan. 15 on a flight to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. On Jan. 19, he checked into an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County complaining of four days of cough and fever. The man wore a mask in the clinic's waiting room before he was examined. He was tested for coronavirus because of his travel to Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, and sent home. The following day, the CDC confirmed the man had coronavirus , and he was transported to Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington, where he was placed in an isolated unit. The man's vital signs were stable despite fever, cough and fatigue. However, chest X-rays taken on his fifth night in the hospital revealed signs of pneumonia, so doctors treated him with oxygen and other medications. The following day, X-rays revealed concerning markings in both of his lungs, \"a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia,\" commonly called walking pneumonia. Doctors administered an experimental, antiviral treatment called remdesivir. Two days later, his condition improved other than an occasional dry cough and runny nose. He remained in the hospital and by Thursday \"all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity,\" the report said. County and federal health officials tracked the man's travel and contacted individuals who came in close contact with him. Some health care workers who treated him at the urgent care clinic were asked to stay home and monitor for symptoms, county health officials said. So far, no one who came into contact with the man has been diagnosed with coronavirus. Reblog What to Read Next\n",

      "A month ago I bet you didn’t think the end of the world would be upon us? I bet you didn’t think a new mega-virus would sweep across the world leaving chaos in its wake?\n",
      "That’s the crazy thing about the world we live in…always expect the unexpected.\n",
      "There’s another uncertain event taking place today. Not in Australia, but over my current neck of the woods. Here in the UK.\n",
      "Today is Brexit Day!\n",
      "As an Australian, I’m still perplexed by the hoo-ha about it all. Surely you’d think being an independent sovereign nation again is a good thing for the UK? Right?\n",
      "Aussies love the fact that Australia is governed by us. WE love the idea of ‘Aussie Made’. We love our patriotic passion for all things competitive sport.\n",
      "But in the UK so many still want to be tied to the teat of the EU. Albeit, it’s a very dry teat. If anything cutting off the decrepit EU might just break free of the shackles the UK has desperately needed over the last decade.\n",
      "Still, with the official Brexit Day being today…who knows what comes tomorrow. Prepare for the good and the bad\n",
      "That’s the kicker to all this. We don’t really know what comes tomorrow.\n",
      "I think Brexit will end up as a good thing. Many others don’t.\n",
      "I also think by the end of the February most people will have forgot about coronavirus. Many others don’t.\n",
      "Will it all get worse, or will things look up as I anticipate?\n",
      "Again, no one knows for sure. And this is the beauty of the world we live in. You get to decide what you believe and who you believe in. You get to make your own decisions on the information you have access to.\n",
      "That’s what makes our world great, the ability to decide on things for yourself.\n",
      "About the only thing we can be 100% certain of is that in 4.5–5.5 billion years, the sun will enter a red giant phase ending all life on Earth as we know it.\n",
      "With that some way off, you really need to know how to properly manage uncertainty here and now.\n",
      "As an investor in particular, you need to know the tools and tricks available to do this. Enter the investment game without knowing the game properly and you’re destined to lose.\n",
      "And where possible, you should do what you can to try and prepare for the good and the bad.\n",
      "Easier said than done.\n",
      "But some basic, shrewd financial actions can give you a little more ‘sleep at night’ factor. And may even do a thing or two for your own mental wellbeing.\n",
      "For example, you should have a bit of cash ready on the side at all times. Just in case things turn tough. Like here in the UK, maybe Brexit causes the economy to break down — in that case you’d want some cash savings in case work dries up.\n",
      "In general, it is a sound piece of advice, I reckon most people should have at least 6–12 months of the mortgage payments tucked into savings. And then a buffer to cover day-to-day running costs.\n",
      "But aside from boring (but maybe lifesaving) savings, you should manage your investments with the thought of all outcomes in your mind.\n",
      "For example, if you’re getting into the market you need to know about buying and selling stocks. You need to know the difference between a market order and a limit order.\n",
      "If you’re getting into small-cap stocks in particular, you’ll need to also be aware of your risk tolerances. And then beyond that you should be familiar with conditional orders. Using conditional orders in the market\n",
      "Conditional orders?\n",
      "You might know about these already, but many people don’t. And if you don’t know about them or use them, you might be missing a trick.\n",
      "For example, there are these great little conditional orders we call stop-loss orders.\n",
      "If you’ve invested into a stock and it starts to fall in value, a stop-loss order can save you. It’s an automatic execution order you put in the market that will sell you out of a position. It does this based on a predetermined loss trigger you set.\n",
      "For example, you invest in Stock A at $1. You then set a 20% stop-loss order. If Stock A falls to $0.80, the sell order will be placed in the market to exit the position.\n",
      "That means if the stock continues to fall further, you limit the downside to the investment. But if your stop-loss triggers and the stock recovers and heads higher, you will no longer be invested in the stock.\n",
      "This is the risk of a stop-loss order.\n",
      "You should always make sure if you decide to use stop-losses they are suitable to your strategy and plans.\n",
      "Of course if a stock flies higher, you can then also use what’s known as a trailing sell order as well.\n",
      "With these if a stock is rising you can progressively ‘lock in’ profits.\n",
      "For example, you might invest in Stock B at $1 and it’s price shoots up 100% to $2. In this case, you might decide to set a 20% trailing sell order as the stock climbs upwards from $1.\n",
      "What happens then is that if the stock then falls 20% from its new high of £2 — i.e. it falls to $1.60 then your trailing sell order is placed in the market and you exit the position.\n",
      "That means you’d have locked in a 60% gain from your initial investment. If the stock went higher from $1–$4 and you had a trailing sell it would only trigger in the event of a 20% fall along the way. If it made it all the way to $4 and then fell 20% to $3.20, you’d have ‘locked in’ the gain of $2.20, 220%.\n",
      "Trailing sells are great to protect rises from the original investment.\n",
      "But if a stock is volatile on the way up they can also exit you from a position that perhaps you don’t want to exit from. That’s why, again, you need to know about them, how to use them and if they fit with your strategy in your portfolio.\n",
      "These are two of the more basic conditional orders you can use while investing to help protect yourself a little. They’re a staple of small-cap investing.\n",
      "So, get to know them, get used to them. And if they fit your plans, put them into play.\n",
      "It’s a smart way to manage your portfolio. In a world where the only certainty is uncertainty — and that stuff about the sun — these are a great way to take emotion out of the investment process.\n",

      "Tweet: GENEVA - The World Health Organization declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in China that has spread to more than a dozen countries as a global emergency Thursday after the number of cases spiked more than tenfold in a week.\n",
      "The U.N. health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a co-ordinated international response.\n",
      "China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.\n",
      "Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and have noted with concern instances in other countries — including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea and Vietnam — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.\n",
      "Speaking to reporters in Geneva, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside China.\n",
      "“The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,\" he said. “Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.\"\n",
      "“This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China,\" he said. “On the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak.\"\n",
      "A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.\n",
      "In the wake of numerous airlines cancelling flights to China and businesses including Starbucks and McDonald's temporarily closing hundreds of shops, Tedros said WHO was not recommending limiting travel or trade to China.\n",
      "“There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,” he said. He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders.\n",
      "“During my discussion with the president and other officials, they're willing to support countries with weaker health systems with whatever is possible,” Tedros said.\n",
      "On Thursday, France confirmed that a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus later became infected himself. The doctor is now being treated in an isolated room at a Paris hospital. Outbreak specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission.\n",
      "China raised the death toll to 170 on Thursday and more countries reported infections, including some spread locally, as foreign evacuees from China's worst-hit region returned home to medical tests and even isolation.\n",
      "Russia announced it was closing its 2,600-mile border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against a new viral outbreak. It had been de facto closed because of the Lunar New Year holiday, but Russian authorities said the closure would be extended until March 1.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus. The man in the U.S. is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak.\n",
      "The case in South Korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier.\n",
      "Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact, like within families, the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus in Japan and Germany is worrying.\n",
      "In Japan, a man in his 60s caught the virus after working as a bus driver for two tour groups from Wuhan. In Germany, a man in his 30s was sickened after a Chinese colleague from Shanghai, whose parents had recently visited from Wuhan, came to his office for a business meeting. Four other workers later became infected. The woman had shown no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to China.\n",
      "“That’s the kind of transmission chain that we don’t want to see,” said Marion Koopmans, an infectious diseases specialist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a member of WHO’s emergency committee.\n",
      "Koopmans said more information was needed about how the virus was spread in these instances and whether it meant the virus was more infectious than previously thought or if there was something unusual in those circumstances.\n",
      "Mark Harris, a professor of virology at Leeds University, said it appears that the spread of the virus among people is probably easier than initially presumed.\n",
      "“If transmission between humans was difficult, then the numbers would have plateaued,” he said. Harris said the limited amount of virus spread beyond China suggested the outbreak could still be contained, but that if people are spreading the disease before they show symptoms — as some Chinese politicians and researchers have suggested — that could compromise control efforts.\n",
      "The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a cousin of the new virus. Both are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that can cause the common cold.\n",
      "The latest figures for mainland China show an increase of 38 deaths and 1,737 cases for a total of 7,736 confirmed cases. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, and one was in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Outside China, there are 82 infections in 18 countries, according to WHO.\n",
      "China extended its Lunar New Year holiday to Sunday to try to keep people home, but the wave of returning travellers could potentially cause the virus to spread further.\n",
      "China has been largely praised for a swift and effective response to the outbreak, although questions have been raised about the police suppression of what were early on considered mere rumours — a reflection of the one-party Communist state's determination to maintain a monopoly on information in spite of smart phones and social media.\n",
      "That stands in stark contrast to the initial response to SARS, when medical reports were hidden as state secrets. The delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide, killing around 800 people.\n",
      "Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of Britain's Wellcome Trust, welcomed WHO's emergency declaration.\n",
      "“This virus has spread at unprecedented scale and speed, with cases passing between people in multiple countries across the world,” he said in a statement. “It is also a stark reminder of how vulnerable we are to epidemics of infectious diseases known and unknown.”\n",

      "Since a case of the coronavirus was detected last Friday in Chicago, Lake and McHenry counties' health departments actively have been monitoring the novel coronavirus situation. There have been no coronavirus cases detected in Lake and McHenry counties at this time, according to local health officials. As of Thursday, five cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the United States, including in Illinois. The first instance of person-to-person transmission of this virus was confirmed on Thursday in Chicago. Although the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency Thursday afternoon, immediate health risks from the coronavirus are considered low at this time, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention . Northwestern Medicine Huntley Hospital, McHenry Hospital and Woodstock Hospital, as well as the Lake and McHenry County health departments, in cooperation with the Illinois Department of Public Health and CDC, have set protocols regarding how suspected patients of the disease should be managed. Primary risk factors include a history of travel to Wuhan City, China, or close contact with a person positive for 2019-nCoV while that person was ill, according to health officials. All patients are being screened with the appropriate questions at the time of their arrival, including if they have travelled to Wuhan City, and if they have a fever or respiratory complaints, said Dr. Irfan Hafiz, an infectious disease specialist and chief medical officer of the three Northwestern Medicine hospitals in McHenry County. Hafiz said he cannot share whether a patient at any of the three McHenry County hospitals recently had traveled to China. For those who have traveled to Wuhan city or have come in contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus, the Lake County Health Department said they strongly recommend that they restrict their movement. “If they do develop symptoms, we have really been trying to emphasize to the public that they should call ahead and let the provider know they're coming in with these symptoms and have this significant history. That will better prepare the clinic or the hospital that is receiving the patient to take the necessary precautions,” said Dr. Sana Ahmed, medical epidemiologist at Lake County Health Department.\n",
      "Many patients in Lake County who have traveled to China in the past two weeks reported some symptoms of the coronavirus, Ahmed said, but did not meet the criteria for the required testing.\n",
      "The Lake County Health Department has taken measures to ensure patients visiting doctor’s offices are not being exposed to the risk, Ahmed said. “The recommendation is to immediately mask the individual with a surgical mask and place them in a negative pressure or airborne room in the hospital. If that is not available in the clinic, then put them in a private room and close that door so you're minimizing that risk of any exposure and they're not in the waiting room at all,” Ahmed said. Health care providers would take necessary infection control precautions, including wearing gowns, gloves, masks and eye goggles to further evaluate patient history. The Lake County Health Department said they are actively disseminating recommendations to Lake County hospitals, health care providers, infection control nurses, Naval Station Great Lake and private institutions to promote awareness and readiness. The communicable disease staff at Lake County have been responding to inquiries from residents, schools and other organizations, providing them with guidance and education as needed. County health departments already have informed parents that the risk is low, and have sent guidance to schools directly. Residents, students, visitors, and workers do not need to change their behavior or use masks or gloves, according to health officials. The Lake County Health Department also has posted signs in English, Spanish and Chinese in their health center waiting rooms to promote awareness among patients. McHenry and Lake County's health departments will continue to provide updates on their website and social media platforms, they said. Health officials warn of confusion between the symptoms of coronavirus and the flu. Current state and federal guidance provides that symptoms of coronavirus include the following: fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Influenza-like illness activity in McHenry County is currently estimated to be high, according to the McHenry County Department of Health. “[Symptoms of coronavirus] are similar to the flu, but there's still a lot that we don't know about how the virus is transmitted, so we're learning things as we go along,” said Melissa Adamson, public health administrator at McHenry County Department of Health. Officials there advise precautions similar to those taken with the flu, including washing hands, covering coughs and staying at home. Related Links\n",

      "Friday, January 31, 2020 by: Ethan Huff Tags: China , contagion , coronavirus , disease , epidemic , global public health emergency , infections , outbreak , pandemic , virus , Wuhan\n",
      "( Natural News ) It’s official: Coronavirus has now reached the four corners of China, with Tibet, the last of China’s 34 regions to not have a confirmed case before now, reporting its very first one .\n",
      "China’s National Health Commission (N.H.C.) issued the proclamation, which coincided with another announcement by the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) officially designating coronavirus as a global pandemic .\n",
      "According to the N.H.C., the Tibet case was identified in the region’s southwestern frontier, while elsewhere in the world reports are coming in of person-to-person viral transmission – meaning infected individuals are now spreading coronavirus outside of China’s borders.\n",
      "Johns Hopkins University recently created a G.I.S. map depicting all of the areas in China where coronavirus has been identified, as well as the number of cases in each region.\n",
      "As you’ll notice, there are dots now blanketing the country, illustrating that coronavirus has not been contained to Wuhan as the communist Chinese government wanted us all to believe.\n",
      "As of this writing, the official infection count is 8,236 cases of coronavirus, and 171 deaths. If coronavirus is now being detected in the remotest regions of China where barely any people live, then this situation is MUCH worse than we’re all being told\n",
      "It’s important to note that the coronavirus case in Tibet, as well as similar cases in Qinghai and Xinjiang, was identified in a very remote and rural area with low population numbers.\n",
      "If the disease has now reached areas that can almost be described as Siberia, in other words, then it’s likely spreading to the four corners of the planet much more rapidly and severely than health authorities are claiming.\n",
      "As of Wednesday, January 29, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases eclipsed that of S.A.R.S. (severe acute respiratory syndrome) from back in 2002-03, which officially topped out on the Chinese mainland at 5,327 confirmed cases.\n",
      "What this means is that coronavirus is a whole different animal , the global impact of which remains to be seen in the coming days. China is rushing to complete two new hospitals in the next week, which together will have 2,300 beds\n",
      "China’s response to the cat getting out of the bag is to hurriedly try to build not one but two new hospitals in under a week, a monumental endeavor that might be too little, too late.\n",
      "Video footage published by Business Insider shows hospital building construction being fast-tracked in China. The new Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital is set to open on February 3, and the Leishenshan Hospital, also in Wuhan, is set to open on February 5.\n",
      "With emergency face masks, hand sanitizer, and other necessities in short supply, China is apparently hoping that these two new hospitals can be effectively used for containment purposes.\n",
      "The Huoshenshan Hospital will have 269,000 square feet and 1,000 beds, while the Leishenshan Hospital will have 323,000 square feet and 1,300 beds, according to official government reports.\n",
      "Here in the United States, however, the situation is largely being downplayed, even as the first confirmed human-to-human infection case is now being reported in our country.\n",
      "“Given what we’ve seen in China and other countries with the novel coronavirus, C.D.C. experts have expected some person-to-person spread in the U.S.,” stated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield in an announcement about the news.\n",
      "“We understand that this may be concerning, but based on what we know now, we still believe the immediate risk to the American public is low,” he added.\n",
      "Multinational corporations like Starbucks, McDonald’s, and even Google are also reporting franchise and office closures throughout China as a precautionary measure.\n",

Capital Markets The closest comparison is the 2003 SARS outbreak, but, despite it now being a global health emergency , according to reports the Chinese coronavirus is not as deadly as SARS and epidemiologists are able to employ better containment techniques today than they were 17 years ago. Unlike 17 years ago, the Chinese economy is much more reliant on retail spending, travel, and personal consumption prompting concerns of a potential impact that at this stage in the economic cycle. Consumer confidence took a noticeable hit in 2003, with that translating to some categories of spending like air travel. But, even with the SARS outbreak still uncontained, and with the Iraq war happening, it was not long before U.S. travelers returned to the sky and resumed normal travel. Durable good outlays slipped into negative territory briefly during the SARS outbreak but rebounded sharply. Spending in all other categories was virtually unaffected. Non-discretionary consumer spending is remarkably resilient even in the midst of uncertainty, but discretionary spending can be more vulnerable to unexpected negative developments. Any fall offs in spending, however, are short-lived as consumers eventually get frugal fatigue during uncertain times. Service consumption is by far the least volatile spending component and represents two-thirds of overall spending. It takes a U.S. recession to weigh on services, and thereby overall spending. U.S. consumer spending will likely not be materially affected , assuming that the current episode does not become more widespread than the SARS outbreak. The latest economic data remains mixed as the US economy continues to muddle through. The Leading Economic index eased in January, in line with market expectations. This index has retreated in four of the last five months which could be a warning of things to come. Unemployment claims increased by 6,000 for the week ending January 18th, but still remain at very low levels. Expect Boeing's production shutdown to have an effect on claims as some suppliers begin to announce layoffs. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job growth is below average it the traditional manufacturing centers in the Northeast and upper Midwest while it is above average in the West South Central and Mountain regions. Turning to home sales, existing home sales increased in December to a year's best 5,540,000 annual units . Supply tightened to three months' worth, supporting price gains with the National Association of Builders reporting existing home prices increased 7.8 percent on year over year basis. Looking at directly economic news, recall that the World Economic Forum in Davos came and went without any major headlines as those gathered renewed their confidence in global economic conditions. Back in the US, the housing market is showing new signs of growth as low interest rates and tight supply drove up home prices in December. Additionally builder optimism is near 20-year high with the market poised for further gains. The FOMC did not release a “dot plot” at its meeting this week, as it only does so in March, June, September and December. The Committee, however, indicated in its last “dot plot” that it intends to keep rates on hold through the end of the year , is not altered after this policy meeting. The committee will now only change rates in 2020 only if growth turns out to be much stronger or weaker than expected or if inflation were to change dramatically, which does not seem very likely. Additionally the FOMC said that the current stance of policy should support inflation “returning” to the 2 percent inflation target . Previously, the statement said “near” the target. This change likely reflects the FOMC’s willingness to allow inflation running a bit above target for a while. We can expect that the Fed will be on hold for the foreseeable future. The FOMC said that the Fed would continue to purchase Treasury bills “at least into the second quarter of 2020.” The Fed started to buy T-bills in October to relieve upward pressure on repo rates at a pace of roughly $60 billion in Treasury bills per month. The FOMC did not specify an amount of planned Treasury bill purchases going forward, which is consistent with the view that the Fed will ramp down its monthly purchases from the current pace of $60 billion per month at some point during the first half of the year. In recent months, the Fed has been successful in providing sufficient liquidity to the market through Treasury bill purchases, and there was no spike in rates at year’s end, as some had feared. (The Desk of the New York Fed released a new FedTrade schedule covering the January 30 to February 13 period in which the Desk will purchase up to $2.825 billion MBS. That calendar starts with today’s operation that will target up to $976 million UMBS30 2.5 percent - $429 million - and 3 percent -$547 million.) Sensibly, the FOMC decided to raise the rate it pays commercial banks on the reserves they hold at the Fed (the IOER rate), from 1.55 percent to 1.60 percent. The effective fed funds rate, which is the rate that is determined in the market, has been trading near the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate (left unchanged at 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent, where it has been maintained since October) for some time, straying from a target more in the middle of the range. This increase in the IOER is largely a technical adjustment and does not represent a fundamental change in monetary policy. By raising the IOER, the FOMC gives banks more incentive to keep reserves parked at the Fed, which should help to push the fed funds rate back toward the middle of the range. Some consider it a de facto 5 bps hike, and overnight GC rates for today, in turn, jumped 5 bps on the announcement. Yesterday revealed that U.S. consumer spending growth slowed, business investment further deteriorated and annualized growth stayed the same at the end of 2019. U.S. Treasuries rallied in response, pressuring yields to their lowest levels since early October, and a key slice of the U.S. yield curve inverted on Thursday for the first time since October, rekindling memories of growth fears. The continued strength in notes and bonds resulted in an inversion of the spread between the 3-month bill yield and the 10-year note yield, but an afternoon pullback in the market returned the spread to zero. How are markets responding to this week’s FOMC events? Rate cut expectations were pulled forward following Wednesday's dovish remarks from Fed Chairman Powell , with the fed funds futures market now seeing above a 50 percent implied likelihood of a rate cut in June, up from a one-in-four chance just a week ago. Today’s U.S. calendar is already underway with December Personal Income & Spending (+.2%, +.3% respectively), Core PCE Prices (+.2%), and Employment Cost Index (+.7%). The weekly, and monthly, economic calendar closes out later today with January Chicago PMI and the final January Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey. Additionally, the Desk of the NY Fed will conduct a UMBS15 FedTrade operation when they purchase up to $224 million 2.5 percent. And Fedspeak resumes with Vice Chair Clarida appearing. We begin today with Agency MBS prices a shade higher and the 10-year yielding 1.55 percent after closing yesterday at 1.56 percent.

      "Tweet: With initial symptoms that resemble other diseases, many people are wondering how to know whether to seek medical help.\n",
      "Q: With the new coronavirus now in the US, am I at risk?\n",
      "A: The biggest risk factors for being infected with the new coronavirus are travel to China, particularly Wuhan and other areas of Hubei Province, and close contact with a person who has a suspected or confirmed n-CoV case. Without those risk factors, the chance for the general American public of catching this virus is low.\n",
      "However, the outbreak is rapidly changing, and it is unclear how the situation in the U.S. will evolve in upcoming weeks.\n",
      "Q: What are the symptoms of 2019 n-CoV?\n",
      "A: Most cases of 2019 n-CoV have had fever and signs of pneumonia, like cough or shortness of breath. In some cases people are not able to breathe on their own and require the use of a ventilator. A small percentage of people die.\n",
      "Q: What should I do if I have any of these symptoms?\n",
      "A: If you experience any of these symptoms within 14 days of travel to China, or within 14 days of coming in close contact with an individual infected with the coronavirus, you should immediately call your health care provider. It is best to call ahead before going to a clinic or emergency room.\n",
      "Your health care provider will evaluate you with the help of your state’s public health department and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If your travel history and reported symptoms fit with n-CoV infection, you may be tested for the virus. Right now that test can be performed only at the CDC, so your health care provider would send samples to the CDC for testing.\n",
      "Q: What else could it be?\n",
      "A: At this time of year many respiratory viruses are circulating in the community, including influenza, RSV, rhinovirus and human coronaviruses, which are different from the 2019 n-CoV virus.

      "Q: So there are other coronaviruses?\n",
      "A: Yes. There are four human coronaviruses that circulate each year in the U.S. They cause 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract illnesses in the U.S., with mild symptoms akin to the common cold. Health care labs can test for these coronaviruses – but not for 2019 n-CoV.\n",

      "Tweet: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus as a global emergency. The disease, originated first in China, has slowly spread across the globe, killing over 200 people. When the WHO declares a global health emergency, it is allowed to make recommendations on controlling the further spread of a virus or disease. WHO Director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated that so far 98 confirmed cases of the novel Coronavirus have been detected in 18 countries outside China. During the press conference, the director-general also noted that that, out of the 7,834 confirmed cases, 7,736 cases have been detected in China. The spread of this virus to other parts of the world has led to declaring Coronavirus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). This declaration gives WHO the right to boost measures to contain the spread of Coronavirus. Upon declaring PHEIC, WHO can put advisories and recommendations in place related to travel like screening at the airports, land borders, etc. WHO also has the ability to review the measures taken by countries to ensure the health and hygiene standards are at par. The decision may also lead to providing funds and resources from the international community for the countries with weaker health systems.&amp;lt; Ghebreyesus, during the press conference, noted that the declaration of Coronavirus as a global emergency is not due to a no-confidence vote in China. “WHO continues to have confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak,” Tedros said. WHO has declared the PHEIC five times previously. These include the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, Polio in 2014, Ebola outbreak in South Africa in 2014, Zika virus in 2016, and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2019. The committee had also put out travel advisories during the 2003 SARS epidemic across regions.Get \n",

      "Tweet: Oil prices rose on Friday following sharp losses this week, as the World Health Organization (WHO) came out against travel and trade restrictions in declaring a global emergency over the spread of a coronavirus that originated in China last year.\n",
      "Oil prices fell nearly four percent through Thursday this week - hitting three-months lows - before rebounding on Friday, with investors and traders worried over how the spread of the virus would impact demand for oil and its products.\n",
      "WTI futures CLc1 were up by 70 cents\n",
      "Oil industry Pixabay \"WHO's decision ... to oppose restricting travel and trades against China boosted market confidence, even though the organization declared a global health emergency,\" said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets. Brent crude futures LCOc1 were 68 cents higher at $58.97 a barrel by 0738 GMT, after falling 2.5 percent in the previous session. Brent is still down 2.8 percent for the week.\n",
      "US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 were up by 70 cents to $52.84 a barrel. The contract fell 2.2 percent on Thursday and is now 2.5 percent lower for the week. Both benchmarks rose by more than $1 earlier in the session.\n",
      "The WHO on Thursday declared that the coronavirus outbreak in China - which has killed more than 200 people there and has spread to some 18 countries - now constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization \"doesn't recommend - and actually opposes\" restrictions on travel or trade with China.\n",
      "Analysts warned of downside risks Despite the rebound in prices on Friday, analysts remained cautious and warned of further downside risks if the virus continues to spread. \"Oil's January correction, a 13 percent drop to be exact, was ripe for a bounce,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.\n",
      "\"Oil is likely to remain vulnerable despite today's optimism that the coronavirus has likely been contained,\" he said. Italy's government decided to halt all air traffic between Italy and China, and airlines including Air France, American Airlines and British Airways have stopped flying to Chinese cities.\n",
      "\"An escalation in alert levels around the world will likely curb demand travel and thus energy,\" said CMC's Yang. Mostly due to a drop in Chinese domestic and international transport activity, Wood Mackenzie lowered its estimates for world oil demand by 500,000 barrels per day for the first quarter of 2020, according to consultant Yujiao Lei.\n",
